Many students complete one or more internships with local companies during their time at PSU. We believe internships provide a valuable training experience which significantly augments the student\u2019s academic program. While some students choose to participate in an internship without receiving college credit, other students find it important that they receive college credit for their internships. NOTE: Internship credits will\u00a0not\u00a0be counted towards the CS degree requirements To receive credit for an internship, a student: Must have completed at least 24 credits at PSU towards their PSU CS Degree by the time the internship begins, including at least 2 PSU CS graduate core courses with a grade of B or better; May count undergraduate CS courses taken at PSU that have not been applied to another degree; Must be admitted to the MS or PhD program; Must have filed a CS Masters or PhD Plan of Study; and Must have a\u00a0PSU CS GPA of at least 3.0\u00a0and be in good academic standing as defined by the University and the CS Department. International students will also have to meet the requirements for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and must consult with the Office of International Students and Scholars Services (intl-services@pdx.edu) to check eligibility. You and your employer should complete and sign the Graduate Internship Approval Form and submit it, along with copies of the internship offer letter, a copy of your\u00a0current DARS or transcripts, and your\u00a0approved plan of study\u00a0to the CS Graduate Advisor no later than the end of the first week of the quarter. We will forward your documents to the appropriate offices on campus and provide you with a copy of all the documents. Once registration opens, we process internship paperwork once a week on Fridays. At the end of each quarter of the internship, make sure you submit a Graduate Internship Status Report form that is signed by both the student and your Supervisor. This will be due to the Computer Science Internship Director no later than 5pm Friday of finals week for the term.Failure to submit the Internship Status Report by the deadline for the term will result in the student receiving a \"No-Pass\" as a grade. In order to get credit for your internship, you\u2019ll need to submit a Special Registration form for CS 504.

Graduate Assistants at Portland State University are represented by the PSU Graduate Employees Union, AFT/AAUP. Teaching Assistantships A limited number of teaching assistantships are available to our best-qualified graduate students.\u00a0These assistantships are granted for one\u00a0term at a time, and are renewable based on the student's performance in coursework and TA responsibilities. A teaching assistantship pays a monthly stipend and a tuition remission. The student might teach a course under the supervision of a faculty member or grade papers for approximately 15-20 hours per week. Our selection process for teaching assistants\u00a0are similar to those used for graduate admission : grades, references, plus evidence of teaching experience or ability. Please note that a PSU Odin account is required to access the application. Apply for TA-ship about this content Research Assistantships Faculty in the department have research grants that support research assistants (RAs). Faculty members choose RAs on an individual basis, but the most important criterion is the student's ability to contribute to the professor's research program. Ordinarily, students are given a research assistantship only after they have been in the graduate program for at least one term and have taken at least one class from the professor. After advancing to candidacy (see doctoral program), doctoral students are normally supported by a research assistantship with their dissertation adviser and may be able to use the work supported by the assistantship as a part of their own research.", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.edu/computer-science/graduate-assistantships", "title": "Graduate Assistantships | Portland State University", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Graduate Courses The following\u00a0list contains all graduate courses that can appear on the Computer Science schedule, including selected courses offered by other departments.
