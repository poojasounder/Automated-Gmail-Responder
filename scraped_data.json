Computer Science Ph.D. Cybersecurity Graduate Certificate Computer Science M.S. The Master\u2019s program in computer science is designed to prepare students for advanced careers in the computer industry, to create a research environment in computer science, and to prepare students for graduate work at the Ph.D. level. See University Master\u2019s degree requirements. The Master\u2019s program in computer science consists of two options. The first option involves the completion of an approved program of 45 credits. The second option requires the completion of an approved program of 45 credits, which includes 6 to 9 credits of thesis. In both options, the coursework includes core courses in theory and programming practice, plus a 9-credit concentration in one of the tracks described below. For the thesis option, successful completion of a final oral examination covering the thesis is required. For more information, visit: https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/master . Core Course Requirement One theory course from: CS 581 Theory of Computation 3 CS 584 Algorithm Design and Analysis 3 CS 578 Programming Language Semantics 3 Total Credit Hours: 3 One programming practice course from: CS 558 Programming Languages 3 Or any 500-level course designated by the department as a \"Programming Intensive\" course, as indicated by the \"P\" suffix in the corresponding 400-level course number. Total Credit Hours: 3 Electives Students must take enough electives to complete 45 total credits for the Master's degree. Electives can be any 500-level CS course and may include up to 6 credits of CS 505 (Reading and Conference) and CS 506 (Special Projects). CS 501 Research, CS 502 Independent Study, CS 504 Internship, and CS 509 Practicum credits cannot be applied. A limited number of credits taken outside Computer Science can count towards the elective requirements, with advisor approval. A minimum of 30 credits must be taken in Computer Science at Portland State University. Given this, students may use a combined total of 15 pre-admission, transfer, and non-CS credits toward their Master\u2019s degree with advisor approval. One additional credit beyond the 15 credit limit can be used provided none of the courses are a 1-credit course. Pre-admission credits (taken before the term of formal admission) can include both transfer and PSU credits. Pre-admission credits taken at PSU are requested via a DARS exception submitted to the Graduate School. This request should be made soon after admission to the graduate program. Transfer credits refer to credits taken from another institution other than PSU. To request approval of transfer credits, complete and submit the GO-21M form (Proposed Transfer Credit) to the CS Graduate Advisor. Students should submit the GO-21 form during the first term of enrollment in the program, so there is sufficient time to complete any additional coursework that may be necessary. Any transfer credits must be approved before graduation paperwork can be processed. OHSU joint campus credits are considered transfer credits and are transferred via a different process. For more information, visit: www.pdx.edu/gradschool/joint-campus-registration . Non-CS credits taken outside of Computer Science, such as ECE or Math, can count towards elective requirements once approved. Students should obtain advisor approval in advance to avoid the risk of taking a course that will not be approved. To request approval, submit a plan of study with the courses listed to the Graduate Advisor. Non-CS courses must be graduate level. All ETM courses are eligible to transfer but students are limited to using only one for the CS degree requirements.

CS 161 Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving (4) (This requirement will be waived for students who have completed CS 162 prior to Fall 2022) CS 162 Intro to Computer Science (4) CS 163 Data Structures (4) CS 205 System Programming and Architecture (4) CS 250 Discrete Structures I (4) CS 251 Discrete Structures II (4) 2. Completion of each of the following non-CS courses with a grade of C- or better. MTH 251 Calculus I MTH 252 Calculus II or MTH 261 Linear Algebra Three Approved Laboratory Science courses Prior to admission, PSU students are expected to complete the Freshman and Sophomore Inquiry series. Similarly, transfer students are expected to complete the Maseeh College lower division general education requirements. Completing the general education requirements prior to admission will allow students to focus on CS major courses and likely result in a shorter time to graduation. Appeals Students denied admission to the Computer Science program may submit a written appeal which will then be reviewed by the department\u2019s Appeals Committee. All decisions are final. Priority Registration Most applicants will have completed 90 credits by the time they complete the opt-in. This gives them registration priority over students that have completed less than 90 credits. Students who complete the opt-in with less than 90 credits may find classes are full by the time they are able to register. The Computer Science Department is unable to provide overrides to allow earlier registration. Pass/No Pass All required classes must be taken for a grade (not P/NP) unless they are only offered as P/NP. There is no GPA penalty for a Pass or No Pass (but the student may be required to retake the class for a letter grade). Additional Information (exceptions, preferences, etc.) No preference is given to PSU students versus students who completed required courses elsewhere. Continuation Criteria Admitted CS undergraduate students who are not making acceptable progress towards their degree requirements will be dropped from the program and required to reapply for admission. Acceptable progress is defined as completion of at least eight credits of coursework with acceptable grades (C or better for required CS courses, C- or better for required non-CS courses), satisfying departmental requirements, over the preceding academic year. Readmission will be determined by the CS Undergraduate Committee. Prerequisite Policy In order to enroll in most upper-division or graduate CS courses, students must be admitted to the Computer Science program or have the instructor\u2019s permission. Before enrolling in any CS course, students should read the course descriptions and ensure that they have completed all prerequisites with a C or better for undergraduate courses, or a B or better for graduate courses. Students who have not met this requirement or who do not meet applicable admission requirements may be administratively dropped from the course. A limited set of upper division CS courses, designated \u201cdual use courses\u201d, may be taken prior to admission, subject to completion of the associated prerequisites. Students should not take a total of more than 8 credits of upper division CS courses, including any dual use courses, before they have been admitted to the CS major. To avoid a gap in available courses that could delay progress to graduation, students should not generally take dual use courses before they have completed the admission requirements. Students are strongly encouraged to consult the CS Department website, or to meet with an advisor, for further details. Laptop Requirement Students registering for upper-division (300- or above) CS courses, must have access to a laptop with wireless Internet access meeting a set of minimum requirements. These minimum requirements can be found on the computer science website at www.pdx.edu/computer-science/laptop . Chromebooks, iPads, and similar devices do not meet the requirements to run many applications that may be used in various CS courses.
