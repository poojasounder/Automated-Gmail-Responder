Postbaccalaureate applications are processed as they are received, generally within 4-6 weeks. Sample Schedules Students who did not take math beyond pre-calculus in their prior coursework are strongly advised to take at least one such course (e.g. calculus, linear algebra, discrete math, etc.) prior to taking CS 250. This sample program assumes the student has modest programming experience and an adequate mathematical background. This sample program assumes the student has no prior programming experience and a limited mathematical background. Frequently Asked Questions Is the admission process to the CS program\u00a0selective? No. At this time, all students that meet the admission requirements are admitted to the CS program. Can I have courses in progress while I submit my application? Yes, courses required for admission may be in progress at the time of application. If the in-progress coursework is not completed with the appropriate grade by the end of the term, CS admission may be revoked and the student may be dropped from all upper division CS courses (see number 4 below). What if I am in my last course at a community college and the course is not on my PSU DARS? Submit a current unofficial transcript from the college that shows the course in progress and your name and attach it to your application. Once your grade is recorded for this class, send an official transcript to PSU Admissions. What does conditional admittance mean? Students that apply to the program with courses in progress and have met all the other requirements will be admitted to the CS program on the condition that they receive a passing grade for the required classes in progress. Students will be allowed to register for upper division CS courses. At the end of the admission term, grades for classes which were in progress will be checked and students that have not passed will have their admission revoked and administratively dropped from their upper division CS courses. Once I'm admitted to the CS program, will my tuition increase? Yes, the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science charges a differential tuition for admitted students to pay for use of College resources.

The master's program is designed to prepare students for advanced careers in the computing industry, to create a research environment in computer science, and to prepare students for graduate work at the Ph.D. level. Students entering the program must have a bachelor's degree and/or adequate background in computer science. The master's program requires the completion of an approved program\u00a0of 45 credits, with a thesis option. Coursework includes core courses in theory and programming practice, plus a 9-credit concentration in one specialization area. Core Requirements (6) Students are encouraged to take these courses as early as possible in your graduate program. One Theory course from: CS 581 Theory of Computation (3) CS 584 Algorithm Design & Analysis (3) CS 578 Programming Language Semantics (3) One Programming Practice course from: CS 558 Programming Languages (3) Any 500-level course designated by the department as programming-intensive (noted by a P in the undergraduate course section) (3) Track Requirements (9) All students in the CS Master's program must take three courses from a single track of the following: Databases Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Languages & Programming Security Software Engineering Systems & Networking The list of required courses and approved electives for each track are listed in the Track Courses page . Elective Requirements (30) Students must take enough electives to complete 45 total credits for the MS degree. Electives can be any 500-level CS course (see specific notes regarding CS 501-509 coursework below). A limited number of credits taken outside Computer Science can count towards the elective requirements, with advisor approval.\u00a0 Read more about Non-CS credits below. CS 505 (READING & CONFERENCE) AND CS 506 (SPECIAL PROJECT) CREDITS Students who are interested in exploring a specific topic or conducting a special research or other project for credit have the option to register in CS 505 (Reading & Conference) and/or CS 506 (Special Project) credits. A maximum of 6 credits of CS 505 and CS 506 can be counted towards the CS Master\u2019s degree elective requirements. Examples: CS 505 Reading & Conference: the student will study a textbook on a particular topic; complete the end of chapter problems; and discuss/present their chapter summaries, exercise solutions, and other content with the supervising faculty member. CS 506 Special Project: the student will gather and analyze data or research an agreed topic and write up their results in a presentable format under the guidance of the supervising faculty member. Students first need to find a faculty member to supervise these credits. The faculty member can help students to develop their idea, to ensure that it is consistent with the academic goals of the program, and to determine the appropriate course number, credit number, and project scope. They will assign the final grade at the end of the term. The By Arrangement Approval Dashboard can be used to register for CS 505/506 credits. Either the student or the faculty member can initiate a request, and once both have approved it, the request is automatically forwarded to the Department for approval and then to the Registrar\u2019s Office for processing. Thesis Option The thesis option requires the completion of 45 credits including 6-9 credits of CS 503 (Thesis) and an oral thesis defense. Students must follow PSU policies regarding committee appointments, defense procedures, formatting requirements, and submission procedures. University requirements and additional information for a master\u2019s thesis are outlined by the PSU Graduate School. A thesis defense must take place in a meeting with the student and the appointed committee. It should be scheduled on a date that meets the GS deadline for the desired graduation term. A room for the thesis defense may be scheduled through the CS department ( csoffice@pdx.edu ). Thesis students will need to send their abstract/bio information and any requested equipment (projector) at least two weeks in advance of the defense to the CS Graduate Advisor ( gccs@pdx.edu ). Advising All newly admitted MS students will be advised by the CS Graduate Advisor. Every MS student is required to maintain a plan of study form , which outlines both courses taken so far towards the degree and courses planned for the remainder of the program. This will also note any transfer and pre-admission courses, non-CS courses, and a student\u2019s intended track. An initial plan must be submitted to the CS Graduate Advisor by the end of the second term after the student\u2019s formal admission to the program. Approval from the CS Graduate Advisor will indicate an acceptable outline of the student\u2019s coursework. However, the plan can be revised at any time by mutual agreement of the student and the CS Graduate Advisor. A final version of a student\u2019s plan of study should be submitted by the student\u2019s last term of the program. Students completing a thesis are required to have a faculty adviser. Pre-admission, Transfer, and Non-CS Credits A minimum of 30 credits must be taken in Computer Science at Portland State University. Given this, students may use a combined total of 15 pre-admission, transfer, and non-CS credits toward their Master\u2019s degree with CS Graduate Advisor approval ( gccs@pdx.edu ). One additional credit beyond the 15 credit limit can be used provided none of the courses are a 1-credit course. Pre-admission credits (taken before the term of formal admission) can include both transfer and PSU credits. Pre-admission credits taken at PSU are requested via a DARS exception submitted to the Graduate School. This request should be made soon after admission to the graduate program. Transfer credits refer to credits taken from another institution other than PSU. To request approval of transfer credits, complete and submit the GO-21M form (Proposed Transfer Credit) to the CS Graduate Advisor. Students should submit the GO-21 form during the first term of enrollment in the program, so there is sufficient time to complete any additional coursework that may be necessary. Any transfer credits must be approved before graduation paperwork can be processed. OHSU joint campus credits are considered transfer credits and are transferred via a different process. Read below for more information. Non-CS credits taken outside of Computer Science, such as ECE or Math*, can count towards elective requirements once approved. Non-CS courses must be graduate level. *Exception:\u00a0only one ETM course will count towards the elective requirements. All ETM courses are eligible to transfer but students are limited to using only one for the CS degree requirements. Departmental Requirements In addition to the departmental requirements, students should review the university master's degree requirements . A minimum of 30 credits must be taken at Portland State University. Maintain good academic standing with a cumulative graduate GPA of 3.00 or higher in all graduate credits earned at PSU.

The PSU/PDX Cooperative Education Program (PCEP) is a two-year cooperative educational program in which Computer Science students work 20 hours per week at one of our local PCEP Partner companies in a series of defined internship roles, while concurrently taking between eight and twelve credits each term on-campus at PSU.\u00a0Pay begins at $27 an hour with semi-annual raises. New internship cycles start approximately every six months (January and July), and interns must work at two or more PCEP companies in at least two different roles during the program. Why Should I Care? The PCEP co-op will give you real-life experience in two different roles (software development and software automation) at two or more different local software companies while allowing you to take eight to twelve credits of coursework each term on campus. Not only will you gain technical experience, you'll also learn how to work in a professional environment as part of a team developing commercial software for a global customer base, while simultaneously building your professional network. A PCEP co-op will jumpstart your career as a software professional. Who Qualifies? Any student admitted to the B.S. Computer Science degree program at Portland State University, who will have completed CS163, CS205, CS302, and CS314, with grades of B or better, by the time their co-op begins may apply.

Their markets range from computer security and web analytics to healthcare, social media solutions and county government, as well as everything in between. The PCEP companies are located in downtown Portland, so students have easy walking and public transportation options for getting back and forth between work and school.\u00a0Many of the PCEP companies support hybrid or completely remote internships. In becoming a PCEP Partner, each company has acknowledged the student's educational goals are primary - they have agreed the internship program must augment, not conflict, with the educational goals of the student. This results in internships that are not only valuable to the company, but are also genuine educational experiences for the student.", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.edu/computer-science/pcep-internship", "title": "PCEP Internship | Portland State University", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is the highest degree offered in any discipline. It is intended for those who will pursue research in the field. The degree is usually required to teach computer science at the university level, and for employment in prestigious industrial research laboratories. Students may enter the doctoral program with a bachelor's degree or with a master's degree, and must have adequate background in computer science. Since completion of the degree requires presentation of a dissertation comprising of original research, the time required is pre-determined. Four to six years of full-time work are typical, less if the student enters with a Master's degree in computer science. Advising Upon admission to the doctoral program, a faculty adviser will be designated by the CS Director of graduate studies to advise and meet the student in regular consultation concerning the program of study and research. Your CS faculty adviser approves the courses in your program, including non-CS courses and courses taken outside of PSU. Students and their advisers will fill out a Ph.D. Plan of Study form after the student successfully completes 9 graduate level credits, no later than 6 months before their Research Proficiency Exam\u00a0(RPE) . Doctoral students are also assigned to additional faculty members that make up an advisory committee during their first term. The role of the committee is to monitor the student\u2019s progress, to offer academic guidance, and to provide a resource in resolving academic or advising issues. The advisory committee consists of three faculty members, but they may come from different research areas of the faculty adviser. The committee will meet with the student in the Fall and Spring terms to generate a written assessment of progress and to set goals in writing for the next term. The committee, in consultation with the CS director of graduate studies, has the authority to delay a student\u2019s RPE date. The committee's opinion shall have strong weight in determining whether the student should continue to receive departmental support in the form of a teaching assistantship. The advisory committee's role is taken over by the dissertation committee when the student advances to candidacy. When a doctoral student begins research work on a PhD dissertation, the faculty adviser should be the person that will supervise the dissertation. If a new faculty adviser has been identified, submit a \u2018 Change of Advisor form \u2019 to the CS Graduate Advisor ( gccs@pdx.edu ). The faculty adviser must be a full-time faculty member and must agree to the change. Any changes should be properly recorded and processed by the CS department. Graduate Assistantships First-year Ph.D. students who are admitted with financial support are typically supported as a Teaching Assistant for up to three quarters, which typically pays a monthly stipend and a tuition remission. The student might teach a course under the supervision of a faculty member or grade papers for approximately 15-20 hours per week. Ph.D. students may apply to serve as a TA for an additional three quarters, but are highly encouraged to connect with a potential faculty adviser for a research assistantship.

Maintain good academic standing with a cumulative graduate GPA of 3.00 or higher in all graduate credits earned at PSU. All regular courses must be graded (not P/NP) and passed with a grade of B or better. Maintain a 3.5 GPA in core course work, with a minimum grade of B. Research, projects, internships, independent study and reading & conference credits may be graded P/NP or with a letter grade. These credits are set up independently by the student and a faculty member. These credits must be passed with a P or a grade of B or better. Students must be registered for a minimum of 1 graduate credit during the term the comprehensive exam is taken. For elective courses: These courses should be used to strengthen the program in the student's research area. CS 501/601 (Research) and CS 509/609 (Graduate Assistant Practicum) may not be counted. A maximum of 6 credits of CS 502/602 (Independent Study), CS 505/605 (Reading and Conference), and CS 506/606 (Special Projects)\u00a0may be counted. Advancement to Candidacy A student is advanced to candidacy after passing the comprehensive exam and successful defense of the dissertation proposal. Comprehensive Examination The comprehensive exam is a university requirement for the doctoral degree. In the CS Department, it takes the form of the Research Proficiency Examination (RPE), covering original research performed by the student. The exam consists of a written paper, public oral presentation, and a public question and answer session. Passing the exam is required before a PhD student can prepare and defend a dissertation. Review more about the comprehensive exam on our Research Proficiency Exam page. Dissertation Proposal After passing the comprehensive exam and identifying a dissertation research topic, a dissertation committee will be appointed to the student and will take over the role of the advisory committee (see Advising section above). If the research topic has changed since admission, students should change their faculty adviser to the person that will supervise the dissertation. If a new faculty adviser has been identified, submit a \u2018change of advisor form\u2019 to the Graduate Advisor ( gccs@pdx.edu ). Any changes should be properly recorded and processed by the Computer Science office. The proposal: Identifies the general research field (e.g. networks) and presents an annotated bibliography of literature relevant to the particular dissertation topic (e.g. verification of network routing protocols). Describes the research problem. Describes the proposed approach to solving the problem, including specific methods to be tried. Gives a timeline for completing the work. The written proposal will be circulated among the dissertation committee, and upon satisfactory agreement, the student will publicly present the proposal. The presentation begins with an oral talk, then the dissertation committee will question the student privately. Students satisfactorily progressing are expected to have a dissertation proposal approved by the end of the third year. The abstract and date for the defense must be submitted to the CS Graduate Advisor at least two weeks in advance of the date of the defense. Dissertation Defense Under the direction and consultation of the dissertation committee, Ph.D. candidates must complete a dissertation consisting of original research. The student will prepare, revise, and correct a draft of the dissertation as directed by the dissertation committee until it meets the approval. The work is expected to be a quality of merit publication in refereed journals or conferences. After preparation of the written dissertation, a candidate\u2019s dissertation committee will conduct a dissertation defense. The candidate is expected to prepare an oral presentation on the research methodology and results. The abstract and date for the defense must be submitted to the CS Graduate Advisor at least two weeks in advance of the date of the defense. The final, approved dissertation should be submitted to csoffice@pdx.edu for posting. PSU has a set of Dissertation Guidelines that describe the format and content requirements for the dissertation. Graduation Procedures Follow the university's outline for Doctoral degrees . Apply for graduation by the first Friday of the first week of the anticipated term of graduation.

The evaluation team will also interview students, staff, and faculty, and examine our facilities, and curriculum materials.\u00a0 A program is accredited only if everything is up to par. Accreditation adds real market value to the degree.\u00a0 For example, some companies (particularly those accustomed to hiring engineers) pay better starting salaries, and sometimes job titles,\u00a0if the employee comes from an accredited degree program. Program Educational Objectives and Student Outcomes The design and delivery of our Bachelor's program is guided and informed by a set of program educational objectives and associated student outcomes that are posted on the department's website. Annual Student Enrollment and Graduation Data Bachelor's degrees awarded in Computer Science and undergraduate enrollment by academic year are available on the degree and enrollment data website .", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.edu/computer-science/accreditation", "title": "Accreditation | Portland State University", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Discover CS Cohort Request Info about Discover CS Cohort Technology influences nearly every field of study and impacts almost every aspect of our lives.

While applying computing to improve the overall well-being of people and the cities they live in is desirable, there are also significant concerns: Concern about fairness, equity, transparency, and accuracy when using collected data for automated decision making that impacts people Concern about the security and resilience of the cyber-infrastructure used to collect, transmit, store and manipulate city data as well as the privacy of the individuals in them The Department of Computer Science at Portland State University, with its collaborations across campus centers and with its relationships with local and regional agencies, is well positioned to address these concerns through a concerted effort that exploits its current strengths in data science, machine learning, cyber-security, and high-assurance systems. To this end, we envision Trusted Cities, Technology for the People , an effort that supports transparent, equitable, and reliable computing that improves the health of people and the cities that they live in . Key to our effort is ensuring that the computing infrastructure being developed and deployed is resilient against attack and disaster, maintains the privacy of its citizens, and equally benefits everyone. Further, innovations in technology needs to be human-centered and socially aware, aiding and computing aid in the health, safety, prosperity, and equitable treatment of its inhabitants. To address this problem, foundational components such as security through construction and cybersecurity are needed to ensure that systems are not vulnerable and that they are dependable and trustworthy under extreme circumstances. In addition, to have confidence in deployed systems, the population needs to not only trust the privacy and accuracy of data being gathered but also trust the process of collecting and using the data to derive actions that can potentially impact them. Towards this end, data science and machine learning expertise will ensure that the underlying technologies work as intended, do not treat population segments unequally due to bias within the data itself or within its analysis, and provides a measurable benefit to people. To support this effort, the Department of Computer Science is undertaking multiple educational programs including innovative curricula for cultivating deep disciplinary knowledge and skills, educational outreach that foster participations from underrepresented groups, programs for increasing economic mobility of students, and service learning activities to ensure all of our citizens are well informed on safety, security, and privacy issues being faced.", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.edu/computer-science/strategic-vision", "title": "Strategic Vision | Portland State University", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Admission to the CS Major Opt In (Odin Required) about Admission to the CS Major Admission to the Computer Science major is an important step on the path to completing the Bachelor's degree, and is necessary before students can register for most upper division CS courses (i.e., CS 3xx or CS 4xx courses). Admission is guaranteed once the required lower-division courses have been completed, but is not automatic : students must complete the opt-in form linked below (or accessed through the button at the top of this page) to confirm that they wish to be admitted to the CS major. The opt-in form is available for the first eight weeks each term and should be submitted in the term after a student has completed all required lower-division courses. Students who have satisfied the requirements and complete the opt-in during that period will be formally admitted for the following term. We encourage students to complete the opt-in form early so that their requests can be processed before registration opens for classes in the following term. Requirements for Admission to the CS Major Current requirements for admission to the CS major are listed in the PSU Bulletin. Students can use the following steps to verify that they have met these requirements: Navigate to the DARS site . (This can also be accessed from myPSU by selecting the \"Academics\" menu item and scrolling down to the \"Academic Planning\" section.) Make sure the \"audit level\" is set to \"PSU - Undergraduate or Post-bac Audit\" and then click \"Continue\". In the drop-down box for \"Degree Program,\" select \"Computer Science - Admission Requirements - ADMIT-CS\" (make sure you pick the option ending with \"ADMIT-CS\"); select the appropriate catalog year; and then click the \"Run Audit\" button. Your audit report will now be displayed. \u00a0To save a copy of the report, click the \"Print/Download\" link to display a printable version, and then use your browser to print or save the report as a PDF file. Completing the Opt-in Form If the message at the top of your ADMIT-CS report is \" All requirements identified below have been met \" (shown in green), then congratulations, you are ready to opt-in! \u00a0Be sure to save a copy of the report as a PDF file, and then proceed to fill out the opt-in form (Odin required). If the message at the top of your ADMIT-CS report is \" All requirements are complete using in-progress courses \", then you are making great progress, but will not be able to opt-in until the beginning of the next term. If the message is \" You're making progress: at least 1 requirement remains unmet \", then you are not ready to complete the opt-in at this time, but you can review the items listed in the DARS report to confirm which requirements you have already satisfied, which ones are in progress, and which ones remain to be completed in a future term. Upper Division CS Courses Before Admission Students require at least 56 credits of upper division CS courses (or 52 credits for those using a Catalog from before Fall 2023). \u00a0However, there is also a requirement that students must complete at least 44 of those credits after admission . \u00a0As a result: Students using the Fall 2023 catalog (or later) can take a maximum of 12 credits (3 courses) of upper division CS classes prior to admission. Students using an earlier catalog can take a maximum of 8 credits (2 courses) of upper division CS classes prior to admission. A limited number of specific upper division CS classes (CS302, CS350, and CS 486) are available to students before admission. Students registering for these courses prior to admission must be careful to avoid exceeding the credit limits described above. Students must have junior standing or higher (90+ credits) to register for these courses. Credits for any other upper division CS courses taken prior to admission (as a result of an approved transfer, for example), will also count towards these limits. Students should generally plan to take these courses in the same term that they complete the opt-in; taking these classes earlier than that may result in a gap in available courses that could delay progress in the major for one or more terms. Students with special circumstances who plan to take any of these courses prior to opt-in should talk to their advisor to ensure they have a plan that will meet their needs. Other courses that students might consider during the term when they opt-in, without impacting the credit limit, include ECE 341, general education courses (arts and letters/social science, or junior cluster courses, for example) or math electives. Questions? Please let us know if you need any help in understanding the requirements or process for admission: Undergraduate and postbac students can email the Undergraduate Adviser at uccs@pdx.edu or arrange a meeting using the information on our advising page .

Continuation Criteria Admitted CS undergraduate students who are not making acceptable progress towards their degree requirements will be dropped from the program and required to reapply for admission. Acceptable progress is defined as completion of at least 8 credits of coursework with acceptable grades (C or better for required CS courses, C- or better for required non-CS courses) satisfying departmental requirements, over the preceding 12 months. Readmission will be determined by the CS Appeals Committee. Differential Tuition Undergraduates admitted to the CS program will be assessed tuition at the Undergraduate Engineering rate (see \u201cDifferential Programs-Undergraduate\u201d in the PSU fee schedule). \u00a0Post Baccalaureate students will be assessed tuition at either the Undergraduate or the Graduate Engineering rate, depending upon the level of course taken. Graduate Program Policies Planning your Course of Study All newly admitted Masters students work with the Graduate Advisor to develop a plan of study. \u00a0Doctoral students are assigned additional faculty members to make up a preliminary Ph.D. committee. When you begin research work on a Ph.D. dissertation, or if you choose to do a master's project or thesis, you should change your adviser to the person who will supervise this process. Your adviser must be a full-time faculty member. You may change advisers, but since the new adviser must agree to the change, and there are PSU regulations about advising duties (particularly for doctoral degrees), you must make sure that any change has been properly recorded and processed by the CS Office. When you apply for graduation, your current adviser must approve your program, and is not necessarily bound by the decisions of a different, earlier adviser. For this reason it is recommended that students discuss their study plans with advisers regularly. Course Load Full-time graduate students typically take 9 credits per term. Approval is required to register in 11 credits or more. To request this, complete the Overload Approval form and submit it to your adviser. Part-time students are defined as those taking fewer than 9 credits per term. Teaching and research assistants are required to complete at least 9 graduate credits each quarter with a grade of B- or better, or a Pass; some of these can be CS 501 (Research) credits that will not count toward the credits required for a degree, and should normally be graded Pass/No-Pass. International students must normally take a minimum of at least 9 credits per term to maintain their status, but there are some exceptions. Information and help on this topic may be found here . Pass/No Pass Usually, other than specifically designated independent study or research classes, courses graded Pass/No-Pass cannot be used toward a graduate degree. Classes taken Pass/No-Pass at PSU (prior to admission) or other institutions may not be transferred for credit. Leaving the Program If you are unable to register for any coursework during a given term, it is your responsibility to inform the CS Department and the Office of Graduate Studies. For details, see the sections on Leave of Absence or Cancellation of Admission and Re-enrollment in the PSU Bulletin. Minimum Grade Point Average Students in the graduate program must maintain a 3.00 cumulative GPA and a 2.70 term GPA at all times. Any student who has a cumulative GPA below 3.00 at the end of a term (based on at least 9 credits), or a term GPA below 2.70 (based on at least 6 credits) will be put on academic probation. A student who has been placed on probation and subsequently violates these GPA limits will be terminated from the University.

As I've grown older, I've come to realize that we should pay more attention instead to the people, including those who build and operate our systems, as well as those whose lives are impacted by the ways that they are used. As computer scientists, we often celebrate the innovations that have been driven by the visions of industry or intellectual leaders; by chance interactions and meetings between small groups of individuals; or by the efforts of larger teams working together, whether in a small garage, a tech start up, or a larger company. Embarrassingly, we have not been as willing to recognize or counter the presence of systemic issues in our field that work to exclude, diminish, or discourage the participation of many people who do not fit the cultural stereotypes for what it means to be a computer scientist. This is not a matter for debate. If you have any doubt, then picture the days, not so long ago, when you might have found yourself in a classroom filled with computer science students, and consider whether the people you would see there are truly representative of the society that we see outside. In recent days, we have witnessed protests and deep unrest, both locally and around the globe, that have drawn attention, once again, to pervasive systemic racism and injustice. It is a deeply uncomfortable reality that many of the people around us, even when they live in the same place, with supposedly the same facilities and opportunities, will nevertheless experience our same world in very different ways. Many of these differences can be traced to differences in the color of a person's skin, and to a long and ugly history surrounding the ways in which people of different races have been treated. This is unacceptable, and it is important to state, not as a slogan that is easily said, but as a personal commitment and focus for my own work, that Black Lives Matter. What can a department like ours do to address the issues that people of color, and those in other underrepresented groups, have to deal with on a daily basis in computer science? I believe that our obligations begin with the need to listen very carefully to understand the experiences of those around us, both in our immediate community, and further away. But we also need to learn from what we hear, and to be proactive in reaching out to improve our education and understanding of these critical topics. Beyond that, but most critically, we need to act , with empathy and urgency; every one of us has an important role to play in working to build the only kind of future that is acceptable, where everyone's participation is welcome, and everyone's contributions and accomplishments are properly recognized. The task ahead is daunting and challenging. It will require dedication and perseverance, and, for many of us, a significant investment of time and energy as we confront unpleasant truths and rethink the way that we structure and conduct our work. In my role as chair, I pledge to make this a top priority for me and for the department. Many of you may have personal insights, recommendations, or criticisms that might help inform our work. I urge you to share those with me, and I promise that I will listen with openness, humility, and a commitment to act on what I learn. But building a fair and equitable future for everyone in computer science will be the biggest innovation that our discipline can deliver, and every one of us has a key role to play in making that a reality.

Students may enter the program directly from high school; after preliminary coursework in a two-year community college program; or after they have work experience in the field without a college degree. The department makes every effort to place students in courses appropriate to their actual level of knowledge. Note that these courses reflect the requirements for the most recent catalog (also known as the PSU Bulletin). For earlier catalogs and inquiries regarding degree requirements, please consult with an Advisor for more information.

Please see the Bulletin for details about which courses are approved for each category. University Requirements The General Education requirements for CS students can be met in one of two ways. Students who complete their entire program at PSU meet the requirement by taking 39 credits of University Studies and the Computer Science Capstone. Students transferring from community colleges having co-admission agreements with PSU (currently Clackamas Community College, Mount Hood Community College, and Portland Community College) may follow this path. Transfer students must have a minimum of 39 credits as a combination of University Studies courses and Liberal Arts / Social Science transfer credits. 12 of these credits must be upper division cluster courses taken at PSU. Beginning with the 2022-23 catalog, all Portland State undergraduate students must fulfill the Race and Ethnic Studies requirement (RESR) to earn their bachelor's degrees. Course Prerequisites Before enrolling in any Computer Science course, students should read the course description and ensure that they have completed all prerequisites with a grade of C or better. Students who have not met this requirement may be administratively dropped from the course. The prerequisites\u00a0for each required CS course can be viewed in graphical form for both the 2022-23 and 2023-24 academic years.\u00a0 In these diagrams, an arrow points to the courses that require the prerequisite. CS Upper Division Electives Registration for 300-level and 400-level CS courses requires admission to the CS Upper Division program. CS Upper Division electives can be any 300-level and 400-level CS courses including CS 410 and/or ECE 455, ECE 456, ECE 485, and ECE 486. A total of 24 credits of CS Upper Division electives are required. \u00a0At least one of these electives must be a Programming intensive course (noted by a P suffix on the course number). \u00a0And at least one of these electives must be an approved Computer Science Security elective (currently CS 491, CS 495, or CS 496). A maximum of 4 credits may count from CS 309, CS 401, CS 405, CS 406, CS 407, and CS 409. CS 404 and any courses specifically described as not being applicable to the CS degree may not be used. 44 of the 52 Upper Division CS credits must be taken at PSU after admission to the CS Program. Postbaccalaureate Postbac students working toward a second bachelor's degree must satisfy all required CS and Non-CS courses listed above, but are not required to take free electives or to satisfy the general University requirements. Courses taken for the first undergraduate degree may be used to satisfy these requirements, provided the student takes at least 45 credits at PSU. For example, a student with an undergraduate degree in physics or electrical engineering will have likely satisfied most or all of the science and math requirements while one with a major in literature or fine arts will likely need to take more courses to earn the CS degree.

This will satisfy the comprehensive exam requirement, which measures a Ph.D. student's\u00a0knowledge within their domain of research. Years are counted from the term in which the student enters the Ph.D. program. Extensions to the two-year period may be granted by a Ph.D. student's advisory committee in consultation with the CS director of graduate studies. Part-time students may routinely obtain an extension to three years. Note, the university limit is 5 years if entering with a MS degree and 7 years otherwise. Students must be registered for a minimum of 1 graduate credit in each term they are taking or working on the RPE. The RPE exam consists of a written research paper and an oral presentation: With the approval of the CS director of graduate studies, a Ph.D. student is assigned to a 3-person committee created by the student\u2019s faculty advisor. The committee members must be knowledgeable in the research area. If appropriate, one member of the committee may be a faculty member from a different department or institution. The Ph.D. student conducts research on a problem and writes a paper that is in a form appropriate for publication at a conference or workshop in that research area. Standard formatting can be used as appropriate for that area. The student schedules the RPE presentation with the RPE committee. Presentations can take place at any time during the academic year, and do\u00a0not need to\u00a0be coordinated with each other. The presentation is open to all and the paper must be\u00a0circulated to the faculty a week before the presentation. The presentation is 45 minutes for the talk followed by 15 minutes for questions. The format is that of a typical technical talk that first motivates the problem, then describes related work, followed by the research contributions. The RPE committee decides on a Pass/Fail/Retake: A pass needs to be agreed upon unanimously by the RPE committee. In case of a retake, the student needs to address the committee's feedback and retake the exam within six months. The exam can only be taken twice.

Many students complete one or more internships with local companies during their time at PSU. We believe internships provide a valuable training experience which significantly augments the student\u2019s academic program. While some students choose to participate in an internship without receiving college credit, other students find it important that they receive college credit for their internships. NOTE: Internship credits will\u00a0not\u00a0be counted towards the CS degree requirements To receive credit for an internship, a student: Must have completed at least 24 credits at PSU towards their PSU CS Degree by the time the internship begins, including at least 2 PSU CS graduate core courses with a grade of B or better; May count undergraduate CS courses taken at PSU that have not been applied to another degree; Must be admitted to the MS or PhD program; Must have filed a CS Masters or PhD Plan of Study; and Must have a\u00a0PSU CS GPA of at least 3.0\u00a0and be in good academic standing as defined by the University and the CS Department. International students will also have to meet the requirements for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and must consult with the Office of International Students and Scholars Services (intl-services@pdx.edu) to check eligibility. You and your employer should complete and sign the Graduate Internship Approval Form and submit it, along with copies of the internship offer letter, a copy of your\u00a0current DARS or transcripts, and your\u00a0approved plan of study\u00a0to the CS Graduate Advisor no later than the end of the first week of the quarter. We will forward your documents to the appropriate offices on campus and provide you with a copy of all the documents. Once registration opens, we process internship paperwork once a week on Fridays. At the end of each quarter of the internship, make sure you submit a Graduate Internship Status Report form that is signed by both the student and your Supervisor. This will be due to the Computer Science Internship Director no later than 5pm Friday of finals week for the term.Failure to submit the Internship Status Report by the deadline for the term will result in the student receiving a \"No-Pass\" as a grade. In order to get credit for your internship, you\u2019ll need to submit a Special Registration form for CS 504.
