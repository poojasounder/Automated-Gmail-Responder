The aim of the RRI is to improve the manner in which social services and service delivery systems are designed, managed, and evaluated. To inform social change initiatives, the RRI is prepared to examine all aspects of the complex process by which human service policies and services are developed and implemented. By bringing a range of consumers, family members, and researchers into its activities, the RRI creates new approaches to old problems. It strives to set high standards for applied social research and to provide a research environment for graduate training. The RRI has undertaken more than 250 projects, many of them national in scope, in fields of child and adult mental health, family and child welfare, child care, employment, juvenile justice, alcohol and drug services, disability, and interpersonal violence. RRI projects range from large, multi-site federally funded grants, to research contracts with state and local governments, to program evaluations in collaboration with local community partners. The RRI is particularly well known for its innovative approaches in consumer-driven and community-engaged research. Over the last five years, total research expenditures for RRI projects have exceeded $32 million. The RRI is home to several centers with national scope and influence. Since 1984, when the Research and Training Center on Family Support and Children's Mental Health was initiated, the RRI has been a leader in the field of mental health research and education. The RRI also hosts Trauma Informed Oregon (TIO), which serves as a centralized source of information and resources, and coordinates and provides training for healthcare and related systems. Since 2000, the national program office of Reclaiming Futures: Public Health, Justice, Equity, has been located in the RRI and promotes new standards of care in juvenile justice for young people with drug and alcohol problems, and its model for system change has been implemented in jurisdictions around the country.

Graduate Certificate in Futures Thinking and Foresight Practice Graduate Certificate in Sustainability Graduate Certificate in Futures Thinking and Foresight Practice This certificate offers students and experienced professionals the opportunity to deepen their understanding of futures thinking and foresight practice to positively impact a highly volatile and complex landscape recently referred to as \"post-normal times.\" Given rapid and exponential acceleration that is occurring across both public and private sectors, a new mindset and new skills are needed to navigate this complexity and build success pathways to desired futures. Increasing \"readiness for the future\" has become an urgent call to action across disciplines and professional spheres of influence. This 18-credit learning experience includes focus on technological change, climate change, geo-political shifts, racial equity and such topics as the future of work, food, learning and more. Foresight is an emerging interdisciplinary social science comprised of psychology, sociology, anthropology and social work, the arts, political science, business, technological studies, urban studies, public administration, engineering and technology sciences, economics, and other geo-political focal areas (to name a few). Futures thinking and foresight practice reflect a collection of applied skills and tools related to a specific type of anticipatory thinking, applied ethics in a futures context and related change management/navigation skills. It is also about increasing proficiency in building collective intelligence, imagination, agency and agility in individuals, groups, organizations and civic collectives with regard to self-determination and democratically anchored futures planning. Interdisciplinary elective coursework will allow students to personalize from among a list of future forward courses that best meet their professional goals and their intended future focus. The certificate includes a deep exploration of settings and methods where foresight is currently being practiced in both the public and private sectors, a review of foresight research and methods and profiles of futurists who lead these processes. With a special focus on leading efforts to build foresightfulness within communities and/or organizations through trend mapping, power analysis, goal setting in a \"VUCA\" practice environment (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity), students learn the fundamentals of engaging individuals, groups and organizations in a positive experience of navigating futures conceptualization and planning. Issues of equity and strategies to democratize co-creation of shared futures, acknowledge/address bias and patterns of historical bias are prioritized. A concluding integration course provides a culminating experience to engage in shared learning and cross-disciplinary review of foresight projects, as well as creation of a professional foresight portfolio useful to those seeking to enhance their career readiness in this area.

The faculty of PSU have designed a four-year program of study required of all students (not required for Liberal Studies or Honors Program) planning to graduate from PSU. This nationally recognized program offers students a clear opportunity to acquire the foundation for the academic and problem solving skills needed to succeed in the 21st century. University Studies offers students a program of connected educational opportunities. The purpose of the University Studies program is to facilitate the acquisition of the knowledge, abilities, and attitudes that will form a foundation for lifelong learning among its students. This foundation is built on four learning goals which include building capacity and the propensity to engage in critical thinking, using various forms of communication for learning and expression, exploring and analyzing the broader human experience and its environment, and appreciating the responsibilities of persons to themselves, each other, and their communities. University Studies begins with Freshman Inquiry, a year-long course introducing students to different modes of inquiry and providing them with the tools to succeed in advanced studies and their majors. At the sophomore level, students choose three different courses, each of which leads into a thematically linked, interdisciplinary cluster of courses at the upper-division level. Students are required to complete 12 credits from one of these clusters. Finally, all students are required to complete a capstone course which consists of teams of students from different majors working together to complete a project addressing an issue in the Portland metropolitan community. University Studies courses transfer to other institutions. For more information or assistance visit the University Studies website www.pdx.edu/university-studies/transferring-credits or the Office in 117 Cramer Hall. Freshman Inquiry See the University Studies Program website ( www.pdx.edu/unst ) for course descriptions Freshman Inquiry consists of a year-long course developed by a team of faculty from different disciplines. Freshman Inquiry has a maximum class size of 36 students. Each class is also divided into three small-group, peer mentor sessions led by specially selected upper-division students. Class material is introduced and explored during the full class sessions and then assignments are developed and discussed in the peer mentor sessions. While the themes and content of the Freshman Inquiry courses differ, the overall objectives are the same. Each of these classes builds a foundation of communication skills for learning and expression. Writing is the core, but communication also includes emphasis on improving oral, quantitative reasoning, and graphic/visual modes of communication. Freshman Inquiry is also designed to help students learn and effectively use current information technologies. Students will also learn how disciplines from the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools approach problems in different ways and how they work together to improve understanding of complex issues. When students complete Freshman Inquiry they will be expected to be able to apply writing, quantitative reasoning, speech, and visual/graphic skills to problems requiring analysis and discovery. Freshman Inquiry will expand awareness of academic potential and prepare students to move on to increasingly rigorous and sophisticated levels of inquiry. Sophomore Inquiry See the University Studies Program website ( www.pdx.edu/university-studies/sinq-junior-clusters ) or online schedule of courses for course descriptions. At the sophomore level, students complete 8 credits of coursework in Sophomore Inquiry. Students select two Sophomore Inquiry classes. Sophomore Inquiry classes are structured similarly to those in Freshman Inquiry with a main class and smaller mentor inquiry workshops, except at this level the mentor classes are led by graduate students. Mentor inquiry workshops focus on weekly learning modules on study skills, writing, technology training, group dynamics, speech and oral communication. Sophomore Inquiry classes maintain an interdisciplinary approach to their individual topics, and continue to emphasize the four University Studies goals of Inquiry and Critical thinking, Communication, Diversity Equity, and Social Justice, and Ethics Agency and Community. Each Sophomore Inquiry class also provides an introduction to important concepts, questions, and concerns that will be explored in greater depth in the upper-division cluster courses to which it is linked. Prior to Fall 2022, The Sophomore Inquiry requirement was 12 credits and was directly linked to the Upper-Division Cluster Theme. The 8-credit requirement only applies to students starting at PSU after Summer 2022. Upper-Division Cluster See the University Studies Program website ( www.pdx.edu/university-studies/sinq-junior-clusters ) for descriptions of upper-division clusters and lists of approved cluster courses. After their Sophomore Inquiry coursework, students select an Upper-Division Cluster. Beginning in Fall 2022, the Upper Division Cluster does not need to link to any of the SINQ courses the student has taken, although it is recommended. From a list of courses approved for the selected cluster, students pursue a program of 12 upper-division credits offered by various departments across campus. These classes allow students to explore an aspect of the cluster's theme in greater depth, while continuing to investigate the four University Studies goals in relation to the cluster topic. Students might choose a cluster to broaden their perspective, allowing them the opportunity to take classes of interest outside their major, or students can choose a cluster to complement their major area of study. In either event, Upper-Division Cluster courses may not be used to fulfill a student's major requirement. In addition, students cannot take cluster courses in their major, or courses cross listed with their major, except for those in the following majors: Arts & Letters, Social Sciences, Sciences, and Urban and Public Affairs. The Upper Division Cluster theme completed is recognized as a note on the student transcript. Senior Capstone See the University Studies Program website ( www.capstone.unst.pdx.edu ) for course descriptions. The culmination of the University Studies program is the Capstone course requirement. This 6-credit, community-based learning course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to apply, in a team context, what they have learned in the major and in their other university studies courses to a real challenge emanating from the community. Interdisciplinary teams of students address these challenges and produce a summation product in a University Studies approved Capstone course under the instruction of a PSU faculty member. The Capstone's purpose is to further enhance student learning while cultivating critical life abilities that are important both academically and professionally: establishing connections within the larger community, developing strategies for analyzing and addressing problems, and working with others trained in fields different from one's own. Independent volunteering, work experience, by arrangement credits, internships and practica cannot fulfill the Capstone requirement. Students must have completed 90 credit hours before registering for their Capstone course. Students should read and follow the Capstone attendance policy.

Students earning a baccalaureate degree will complete a rigorous program of study leading to mastery of the chosen field of study at the undergraduate level. In addition, Portland State University is committed to providing the foundation for continued learning after completing the baccalaureate degree. This foundation includes the capacity to engage in inquiry and critical thinking, to use various forms of communication for learning and expression, to gain an awareness of the broader human experience and its environment (local, national, and international), along with an ability to appreciate the responsibilities of individuals to themselves, each other, and community. Undergraduate students at Portland State University may work toward a Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelor of Science, a Bachelor of Fine Arts, or a Bachelor of Music degree with one or more majors. See Programs of Study for majors leading to a baccalaureate degree. Students working toward a bachelor's degree must complete the (1) University requirements, (2) University Studies (general education) requirement, (3) University Writing Requirement, (4) Race & Ethnic Studies Requirement (RESR) (5) Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science requirements, (6) requirements for a major, and (7) Foreign Language competency if admitted with a high school foreign language deficiency. Students majoring in Liberal Studies or completing the Urban Honors Program do not need to meet the University Studies general education requirement. Specific requirements for a baccalaureate degree are detailed in the undergraduate degree and credential requirements section . Students pursuing supplementary programs must complete additional requirements as specified in the curricula of these programs. Students working toward a bachelor's degree may wish to supplement their major coursework with: A certificate program which is an approved academic award given in conjunction with the satisfactory completion of a program of instruction, signifying a standard of knowledge in a specific subject. Certificate types vary, with some available as part of a baccalaureate degree program, others available in non-degree status, and others available to post-baccalaureate students. A minor is an optional, undergraduate credential, comprised of a formally defined set of courses in a declared secondary subject area/field of study, distinct from and outside of the degree major. For a list of available certificates and minors, see Programs of Study . Assessment Portland State University assesses undergraduate student learning and engagement related to the eight Undergraduate Campus-Wide Learning Outcomes: Communication; Creative and Critical Thinking; Disciplinary and/or Professional Expertise; Diversity; Engagement; Ethics and Social Responsibility; Internationalization; and Sustainability through a variety of activities. Assessment of student learning and engagement occurs at classroom, departmental and institutional levels. Your participation in assessment matters, as results are used to improve teaching and learning, program structure, course content, and the overall student experience at Portland State University. The types of assessments students might engage include standardized tests, placement tests, surveys, course evaluations, portfolios of student work, group or individual interviews, or classroom research, to name a few. Incoming students to PSU may be required to take a writing assessment and, based on the results of that assessment, take an assigned writing course. Academic standing policy Undergraduate, Postbaccalaureate and Non-Degree Seeking Students The faculty Scholastic Standards Committee (SSC) has the authority to place on Academic Warning, Probation or Dismissal any student according to the following standards: Academic Warning Any student with 12 or more attempted credits (including PSU and transfer work) whose cumulative PSU GPA falls below 2.00 will be placed on academic warning. A registration hold will also be applied to the student record until completion of a mandatory intervention facilitated by advising and career services. Students on academic warning are restricted to registering for 13 or fewer credits per term. Academic Probation Students on academic warning will be placed on academic probation if they do not meet at least one of the following requirements: Raise the cumulative PSU GPA to 2.00, thereby returning to good standing or Earn a GPA for the given term of 2.25 or above, thereby remaining on academic warning and subject to the same requirements in the next term. A registration hold will be applied to the student record until the completion of an academic coaching appointment facilitated by the Learning Center. Students on academic probation are restricted to registering for 13 or fewer credits per term. Academic Dismissal Students on academic probation will be dismissed if they do not meet at last one of the following requirements: Raise the cumulative PSU GPA to 2.00, thereby returning to good standing or Earn a GPA for the given term of 2.25 or above, thereby remaining on academic probation and subject to the same requirements for the next term. Notes Grade changes or removal of Incomplete grades do not change academic standing status. Academic standing status in the current term may be changed by engaging the repeat policy, however repreating courses will not retroactively change the status of a past term. Students who are academically dismissed from PSU are not permitted to register either full-time or part-time (including 1-8 credits) When evaluating undergraduate academic standing, only PSU undergraduate credit is considered. Students on academic warning or academic probation who receive only grades of I, X and/or NP will lose academic standing. Reinstatement A student who is dismissed may be reinstated in one of two ways. One is to petition and be approved for reinstatement by the Scholastic Standards Committee. Petitions for current term reinstatement must be returned to the Office of the Registrar prior to the beginning of the term for a timely decision. Alternately, conferral of an accredited transferable Associate's or Bachelor's degree earned subsequent to the dismissal from PSU, will constitute automatic reinstatement to the University. An official transcript with the degree posted must be presented to the Office of the Registrar. Reinstated students are given probation status. Graduate Students and Postbaccalaureates taking graduate level courses Graduate Academic Standing is administered by the The Graduate School. See the Graduate Studies section of this Bulletin for policy details. Credit for Prior Learning (CPL) Portland State University recognizes that adults entering or returning to college bring with them a wide variety of prior learning experiences including work, travel, volunteering, activities in professional organizations, or self-study. CPL allows qualified undergraduate students to earn credit for college-level learning outside of the classroom. PSU offers four types of CPL credit : PSU Departmental Challenge Exam Prior Learning Portfolio (The portfolio option is not available at this time) College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Military Credit CPL Academic Policies Student Eligibility: PSU Challenge Exam and Prior Learning Portfolio review requires students to be formally admitted to PSU as an undergraduate and to be enrolled in or have completed one PSU course. Students enrolling in Prior Learning Portfolio must also be in Academic Good Standing. CLEP and Military Credit is evaluated and awarded as transfer credit at the time a student is formally admitted to PSU, prior to matriculation/enrollment . Grading: CPL credit is limited to Pass-only grading and, as such, will not have a GPA effect. A \"No Pass\" assessment is not recorded on the PSU transcript and will have no impact on the GPA calculation. Pass/No Pass Limit: PSU Exam and Portfolio credit are included in the calculation of the 45-hour limit on Pass credit. CLEP and Military Credit are exempt from the 45 P/NP limit. Transcripts: Credit earned by PSU Challenge Exam and Prior Learning Portfolio will be included and appear as institutional credit on the PSU official transcript. It will be identified as CPL credit. CLEP and Military Credit awards are not included on the PSU Official Transcript. CLEP and Military Credit awards are treated like transfer credit and may apply towards PSU degree requirements and appear on the PSU Degree Audit. CPL Limits: No more than 45 credits of PSU Challenge Exam and Prior Learning Portfolio credit can apply toward a PSU degree. CPL can be used to complete degree requirements unless it is restricted in a major by a particular academic unit. Repeat Policy: CPL is not eligible for the PSU Repeat Policy. Earning CPL credit for a course in which a student had previously earned a D or F does not remove the prior grade from the GPA calculation. Residency Requirement: CPL credit will not count toward the PSU credits in residence requirement. University Studies Placement: CLEP and Military Credit will be combined with the transfer credit to establish placement into the University Studies general education program. PSU Exam and Portfolio credit will not be used to establish placement. CPL can be awarded in courses that have been approved by academic departments. Not all courses in all departments are open to challenge. Each academic unit decides which of its courses are available to undergraduates for CPL credit. No courses numbered 199, 299, 399, or 401 to 410 inclusive are eligible for CPL credit. Credit earned by CPL may not be received in a course which: Duplicates credit previously earned by a student, or Is more elementary, as determined by departmental, college, or school regulations, than a course in which the student has already received credit. Department permission is required in order to re-attempt CPL credit for the same course, after a non-passing prior attempt. Undergraduate Degree and Credential Requirements To earn a baccalaureate degree a student must complete (1) University requirements, (2) University Studies - General Education requirements, (3) University Writing Requirement, (4) Race & Ethnic Studies Requirement, (5) specific requirements for the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science Degree, (6) requirements for a major, and (7) Second Language competency if admitted with a High School Second Language Deficiency. Students earning a single major in Liberal Studies, or completing the Urban Honors program do not need to meet the University Studies General Education requirements. Students bear final responsibility for ensuring that the courses taken are applicable toward satisfying their degree requirements. Postbaccalaureate Credential Requirements Second Baccalaureate Degree A candidate for a second baccalaureate degree must complete the following: Residence credit after earning first degree: if the first degree was from Portland State University, 36 credits; if the first degree was from another college or university accredited by a recognized regional association, 45 credits.

Admitted postbaccalaureate students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.00 on all work taken at PSU. Failure to do so will result in academic warning, probation, or dismissal. Postbaccalaureate students who do not hold a degree from a university in the U.S., English-speaking Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand must satisfy the Wr 323 requirements before graduation from PSU. Postbaccalaureate Certificates Postbaccalaureate Certificates are approved academic awards given in conjunction with the satisfactory completion of a program of instruction, signifying a standard of knowledge in a specific subject.The curriculum is designed for students to complete after they have already earned a bachelor's degree. To be eligible to earn the certificate, the student must be admitted and matriculated into postbaccalaureate or graduate status. A Postbaccalaureate Certificate is posted to the official transcript and documented on a separate diploma. In addition to meeting the specific course requirements of the certificate, students must: Hold a previously earned baccalaureate degree. Meet the Residency Requirement: a minimum of 16 credits or 3/4 of the credits required for the certificate, whichever is higher, must be earned at Portland State University. Students who do not hold a degree from a university in the U.S., English-speaking Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand must satisfy the Wr 323 requirement. Grading System for Undergraduates The undergraduate grading system applies only to undergraduate courses. The undergraduate grading system gives students the choice of taking certain courses designated by departments for either differentiated (A, B, C, D, F) or undifferentiated (pass or no pass) grades. The following grading scale is employed at the undergraduate level: A = 4.00 B- = 2.67 D+ = 1.33 A- = 3.67 C+ = 2.33 D = 1.00 B+ = 3.33 C = 2.00 D- = 0.67 B = 3.00 C- = 1.67 F = 0.00 Evaluation of a student's performance is determined by the following grades: A--Excellent B--Good C--Satisfactory D--Inferior F--Failure P--Pass NP--No pass The following marks are also used: I--Incomplete IP--In Progress W--Withdrawal AU--Audit X--Non-attendance and No basis for grade M--Missing grade/No grade received Pass/No Pass Grading Options The online Class Schedule identifies courses as offered under the differentiated or undifferentiated option. Students electing the undifferentiated grade option when it is offered are graded pass or no pass. In the majority of instances, a pass grade is equated to a C- grade or better, although some departments may differ. (NOTE: At the graduate course level the equivalent of a B- grade or better is required to earn a grade of P). Pass/No Pass grades are not used in computing a student's GPA. A maximum of 45 credits graded P may be applied toward Portland State's baccalaureate degree. Students elect grade options for specific courses during the registration period. Grading options may not be changed after the seventh week of the term. The undifferentiated grade option may not be used to repeat a course previously taken for differentiated grade or for major requirements in some departments. Incomplete Grades Students do not have a right to receive/demand an Incomplete grade. The option of assigning an Incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor when the following criteria are met. Eligibility Criteria Required satisfactory course completion/participation. The quality of the work is satisfactory, but some essential work remains. In addition, the student must have successfully completed most of the course work at the time the student requests the Incomplete, with a minimum grade up to that point of a C- for undergraduate, or B- for a graduate level course. Reasonable justification for request . Reasons for assigning the Incomplete must be acceptable by the instructor. A student does not have the right to demand an Incomplete. The circumstances should be unforeseen or be beyond the control of the student. The instructor is entitled to request appropriate medical or other documentation to validate the student's request. Incomplete grade is not a substitute for a poor grade . The Incomplete grade is not meant to create the opportunity for special or additional work for a student to raise a poor grade, or for the opportunity to take the course over by sitting in on the course in a later term without registering or paying for it. Written agreement . A written or electronic agreement will be endorsed by both the instructor and student. The document will specify a) the remaining work to be completed, b) the highest grade which may be awarded upon submission of remaining items, and c) the date which the missing work is due. The latter may not exceed one year from the end of the term for enrollment for the given course. A template \"Incomplete Contract\" is available at www.pdx.edu/registration/grading-system . Resolving the Incomplete . Instructors may not encourage students to \"sit in\" an entire future course in order to resolve the Incomplete grade. If the student needs to retake the entire course, they should be given the grade presently earned, and must formally register for the future class they will be attending. If the missed portion of the course is no longer available, instructors may offer an alternative assignment. Grading weight of the alternative assignment should not exceed the original assignment. Students are fully responsible for monitoring all due dates. Other Rules: GPA Calculation : Incomplete grades are not included when calculating GPA. Deadline for Completion : The deadline for completion of an Incomplete is one calendar year. The instructor may set a shorter deadline, which is binding. Any request for a longer deadline must be requested via petition to the Scholastic Standards Committee or Graduate Council. Failure to make up an Incomplete by the end of one year : Undergraduate Incomplete Grades: The mark of \"I\" will automatically change to a grade of \"F\" or \"NP\", depending on the grading option chosen by the student upon registration. If the Incomplete converts to an F, the F grade is included in calculating GPA. Graduate Incomplete Grades: The Incomplete will become part of the permanent record for a graduate course. Graduating Undergraduate Students : Incompletes awarded in undergraduate courses taken in Fall 2006 or later will automatically change to a grade of \"F\" or \"NP\" before conferral of the degree. The faculty of record may submit a grade change no later than 30 days after the degree is awarded. Grades of \"F\" or \"NP\" will remain on the academic record after this period and cannot be removed. Drops and withdrawals The student must initiate drop/withdrawals from a course. It is the student's responsibility to withdraw properly by the deadline dates published online at www.pdx.edu/registration/calendar . To avoid having to pay special course deposit fees, students should refer to departmental policies. A student may drop with no record of the course on the transcript up to the end of the second week of the term. As a courtesy, students are advised to notify the instructor concerned of the intended drop. A student may withdraw for any reason before the end of the seventh week. A student withdrawing in the third through the seventh week will have a \"W\" recorded on the transcript. A student cannot withdraw after the seventh week without approval of the Deadline Appeals Committee. A \"W\" is recorded if the petition is allowed. Deadline dates for drops and withdrawals are found in the academic calendar published online at www.pdx.edu/registration/calendar . X Grade: Non-attendance and No Basis for Grade The X grade is used when there is little or no attendance and no work/performance upon which to base an academic evaluation. X grades cannot be changed after initial submission and other grades cannot be changed to X except in cases of bona fide grading error as documented by instructor, requiring department chair approval. X grades carry no credit and are not included when calculating GPA. M Grade: Missing Grade M grades are automatically assigned by the system when grades have not been submitted to the Office of Registrar by the grading deadline. M grades will change to a grade of X, one term after the initial term. Once converted to an X, grade cannot be changed except in cases of bona fide grading error as documented by instructor, requiring department chair approval. M grades carry no credit and are not included when calculating GPA. Non-Completion of Course A student who has participated in a course but who has failed to complete essential work or attend examinations, and who has not communicated with the instructor, will be assigned a D, F, NP, or whatever grade the work has earned. Students who have not attended, nor participated in a course may receive an X grade. Grade Point Average (GPA) The Office of the Registrar computes current and cumulative GPAs on student grade reports and transcripts, according to the following scale: A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0. A plus grade increases the points by 0.33, a minus decreases it by 0.33 (e.g., B- = 2.67). Cumulative grade point averages include all credits and points earned at PSU. The GPA calculation is truncated at two decimal points (i.e. rounding up is not used). Separate GPAs are calculated for undergraduate courses and for graduate courses. Further details on academic standing can be found at www.pdx.edu/registration/academic-standing . GPA Repeat Policy This policy only applies to undergraduate duplicate courses. Credit and GPA are retained on the first A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, and all grades in subsequent attempts count in GPA. The first PSU grade of D or F may be forgiven if repeated at PSU for a differentiated grade (not P/NP). In this case, credit is retained on the last grade received. Both grades are retained on the transcript. If repeated more than once, each subsequent grade will be retained on the transcript and counted in the GPA. Credit for Prior Learning and Credit by Exam are not eligible for use in the Repeat Policy. Latin honors at graduation Latin honors designations are conferred at the baccalaureate level to students who have earned the requisite PSU GPA and who have earned a minimum of 72 credits from PSU, with at least 60 of those credits taken for differentiated grades (A-F). The GPA calculation is based on PSU credit and utilizes the current PSU repeat policy. The award levels are as follows: summa cum laude--3.90-4.00 magna cum laude--3.80-3.89 cum laude--3.67-3.79 Latin honors are noted on academic transcripts, inscribed on diplomas, and honors candidates are identified in the commencement program. President's List and Dean's List Awards Portland State University recognizes and honors the academic accomplishments of our undergraduate students each term by awarding placement on the Dean's List and the President's List. High achieving students, as indicated by grade point averages, are placed on the Dean's or the President's List according to the criteria established by the Council of Deans. Dean's List and President's List awards are only given to undergraduate students who have not yet earned a baccalaureate degree. The awards are given at the end of each term. The award is acknowledged with a notation on the student's academic transcript. Full-time Students who have a term GPA of 4.00 are placed on the President's List, and students who have a term GPA of 3.75-3.99 are placed on the Dean's List. Students on both lists must be admitted undergraduate students with a cumulative GPA of 3.50 or better, carrying 12 credits or more (excluding AU and P/NP credits). Part-time Admitted undergraduate students with a cumulative GPA of 3.50 or better, carrying fewer than 12 credits for a given term may qualify for the President's List (4.00 GPA) or Dean's List (3.75-3.99 GPA) if both of the following conditions are met: A minimum of three part-time terms must be completed in succession, without interruption by either a term of full-time enrollment or the awarding of Dean's List or President's List At least 12 credits (excluding AU and P/NP credits) must be earned over the combined part-time terms and the student must have an average GPA of 4.00 (President's List) or 3.75-3.99 (Dean's List) over the combined terms Transfer Credit Policies Accredited colleges and universities The Office of the Registrar, in consultation with academic units evaluates credits from accredited colleges and universities. Portland State University accepts college-level credits earned in academic degree programs at colleges and universities accredited by regional accrediting associations and as recommended in Transfer Credit Practices of Designated Educational Institutions. All courses are evaluated to be either equivalent or parallel to PSU courses. Equivalent means that the catalog course description is substantially equal to that in the Portland State University Bulletin. Parallel means that the course is in a discipline which is offered by Portland State, even though PSU does not offer the specific course. Unaccredited institutions and foreign colleges and universities Departmental representatives, working through the Office of the Registrar, are authorized to evaluate credits transferred from unaccredited institutions or foreign colleges and universities after a student has been admitted to PSU. For specific course equivalency, students may be asked to provide catalog descriptions and/or documents certifying course content. Work from unaccredited schools is evaluated in accordance with the institutions and policies listed in Transfer Credit Practices, published by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. Credit given for a particular course will not exceed credit given for the equivalent or corresponding PSU course. Co-admission programs Portland State University has established co-admission programs with Chemeketa Community College, Clackamas Community College, Clark College, Clatsop Community College, Mt. Hood Community College, Oregon Coast Community College, and Portland Community College. Each co-admission program allows students to concurrently enroll at both PSU and the community college campus. For more information go to https://www.pdx.edu/admissions/co-admission . Associate degree transfer Students who upon admission have completed an Associate of Arts-Oregon Transfer (AAOT) or an Associate of Science Oregon Transfer-Business (ASOT-B) or an Associate of Science Oregon Transfer - Computer Science (ASOT-CS) degree at an accredited Oregon community college or another PSU-approved associate degree, have met all lower-division general education requirements, which includes freshman and sophomore University Studies requirements. The student must still fulfill any outstanding upper-division general education requirements. The transfer Associates may not satisfy all requirements for admission to professional schools. Please check with each school for specific admission requirements. Oregon Transfer Compass Programs Core Transfer Map (CTM) Transfer students who present an earned CTM from an Oregon community college will be granted a minimum of 30 quarter credits applied to PSU general education requirements. Major Transfer Map (MTM) Major Transfer Maps (MTMs) are statewide agreements that create streamlined and guaranteed paths for students transferring from an Oregon community college to an Oregon university, based on the chosen major field. MTMs specify clear course-taking paths necessary for on-track progress towards a specific major/bachelor's degree. MTMs build on the 30-credit general education foundation defined by the generic Core Transfer Map (CTM), although MTMs may specify particular relevant/required General Education courses as part of the 30-credit CTM component of the MTM. The individual MTMs identify the optimal and specific set of community college courses students need to take to transfer efficiently into the major at the university. The successful completion of an MTM program that PSU participates in allows students to receive status at PSU, based on the number of academic credits referenced in the MTM agreement, including at least 30 credits of general education satisfied, that is comparable to the status of students with the same number of academic credits in the major course of study who began their postsecondary studies at PSU. The students will not be required to retake a course, as long as the minimum required grades have been earned. Students must have earned a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 and meet the residency requirements at the community college awarding the MTM. When students complete an MTM, the general education courses in the \"Core Transfer Map\" portion of the MTM, for which minimum required grades have been earned, are guaranteed to transfer into general education, degree, or major requirements for a bachelor's degree. Students who want to transfer prior to completing the MTM should talk with their community college advisor and an advisor at PSU prior to transfer about how their courses will count towards general education requirements and degree/major requirements. If the MTM is not awarded advisors can guide students to determine if they are eligible for a CTM. Students are responsible for informing the admissions counselor or intake advisors at PSU that they are completing an MTM. It is important for students to understand that completing the MTM in two years and the bachelor's degree in four years requires them to complete a minimum average of 15 credits per quarter (or 45 credits per year). Oregon Transfer Module (OTM) Transfer students who present an earned OTM from another Oregon institution will be granted a minimum of 45 quarter credit hours toward their general education graduation requirements. Vocational and Career-Technical credits Portland State University grants up to 12 credits for courses which are deemed vocational-career technical. These credits are transferred to PSU as general elective credits. Correspondence credit A maximum of 60 correspondence credits are acceptable in transfer from regionally accredited schools recognized as institutions of higher education. Community and junior colleges The number of lower-division credits to be accepted in transfer from regionally accredited community and junior colleges is limited to 124. College courses completed before high school graduation College courses taken before a high school diploma is received are accepted in transfer provided the student receives grades of D- or above in the courses and the grades are posted on a college transcript. Health Science Professions Students who have completed preprofessional programs at PSU may transfer up to 48 credits of their professional health science work from schools accredited by a regional association and/or as indicated in Transfer Credit Practices. The health science students may not receive a bachelor's degree from PSU and from the professional school when both degrees are based essentially on the same credits completed by the student. The residence credit requirement is satisfied by completing 45 of the last 60 credits at PSU, after admission to PSU and prior to formal enrollment in the qualifying professional program. The student must be within 48 credits of receiving a bachelor's degree from PSU at the time of matriculation into the professional program.

CPL allows qualified undergraduate students to earn credit for college-level learning outside of the classroom. PSU offers four types of CPL credit : PSU Departmental Challenge Exam Prior Learning Portfolio (The portfolio option is not available at this time) College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Military Credit CPL Academic Policies Student Eligibility: PSU Challenge Exam and Prior Learning Portfolio review requires students to be formally admitted to PSU as an undergraduate and to be enrolled in or have completed one PSU course. Students enrolling in Prior Learning Portfolio must also be in Academic Good Standing. CLEP and Military Credit is evaluated and awarded as transfer credit at the time a student is formally admitted to PSU, prior to matriculation/enrollment . Grading: CPL credit is limited to Pass-only grading and, as such, will not have a GPA effect. A \"No Pass\" assessment is not recorded on the PSU transcript and will have no impact on the GPA calculation. Pass/No Pass Limit: PSU Exam and Portfolio credit are included in the calculation of the 45-hour limit on Pass credit. CLEP and Military Credit are exempt from the 45 P/NP limit. Transcripts: Credit earned by PSU Challenge Exam and Prior Learning Portfolio will be included and appear as institutional credit on the PSU official transcript. It will be identified as CPL credit. CLEP and Military Credit awards are not included on the PSU Official Transcript. CLEP and Military Credit awards are treated like transfer credit and may apply towards PSU degree requirements and appear on the PSU Degree Audit. CPL Limits: No more than 45 credits of PSU Challenge Exam and Prior Learning Portfolio credit can apply toward a PSU degree. CPL can be used to complete degree requirements unless it is restricted in a major by a particular academic unit. Repeat Policy: CPL is not eligible for the PSU Repeat Policy. Earning CPL credit for a course in which a student had previously earned a D or F does not remove the prior grade from the GPA calculation. Residency Requirement: CPL credit will not count toward the PSU credits in residence requirement. University Studies Placement: CLEP and Military Credit will be combined with the transfer credit to establish placement into the University Studies general education program. PSU Exam and Portfolio credit will not be used to establish placement. CPL can be awarded in courses that have been approved by academic departments. Not all courses in all departments are open to challenge. Each academic unit decides which of its courses are available to undergraduates for CPL credit. No courses numbered 199, 299, 399, or 401 to 410 inclusive are eligible for CPL credit. Credit earned by CPL may not be received in a course which: Duplicates credit previously earned by a student, or Is more elementary, as determined by departmental, college, or school regulations, than a course in which the student has already received credit. Department permission is required in order to re-attempt CPL credit for the same course, after a non-passing prior attempt.

The undergraduate grading system gives students the choice of taking certain courses designated by departments for either differentiated (A, B, C, D, F) or undifferentiated (pass or no pass) grades. The following grading scale is employed at the undergraduate level: A = 4.00 B- = 2.67 D+ = 1.33 A- = 3.67 C+ = 2.33 D = 1.00 B+ = 3.33 C = 2.00 D- = 0.67 B = 3.00 C- = 1.67 F = 0.00 Evaluation of a student's performance is determined by the following grades: A--Excellent B--Good C--Satisfactory D--Inferior F--Failure P--Pass NP--No pass The following marks are also used: I--Incomplete IP--In Progress W--Withdrawal AU--Audit X--Non-attendance and No basis for grade M--Missing grade/No grade received Pass/No Pass Grading Options The online Class Schedule identifies courses as offered under the differentiated or undifferentiated option. Students electing the undifferentiated grade option when it is offered are graded pass or no pass. In the majority of instances, a pass grade is equated to a C- grade or better, although some departments may differ. (NOTE: At the graduate course level the equivalent of a B- grade or better is required to earn a grade of P). Pass/No Pass grades are not used in computing a student's GPA. A maximum of 45 credits graded P may be applied toward Portland State's baccalaureate degree. Students elect grade options for specific courses during the registration period. Grading options may not be changed after the seventh week of the term. The undifferentiated grade option may not be used to repeat a course previously taken for differentiated grade or for major requirements in some departments. Incomplete Grades Students do not have a right to receive/demand an Incomplete grade. The option of assigning an Incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor when the following criteria are met. Eligibility Criteria Required satisfactory course completion/participation. The quality of the work is satisfactory, but some essential work remains. In addition, the student must have successfully completed most of the course work at the time the student requests the Incomplete, with a minimum grade up to that point of a C- for undergraduate, or B- for a graduate level course. Reasonable justification for request . Reasons for assigning the Incomplete must be acceptable by the instructor. A student does not have the right to demand an Incomplete. The circumstances should be unforeseen or be beyond the control of the student. The instructor is entitled to request appropriate medical or other documentation to validate the student's request. Incomplete grade is not a substitute for a poor grade . The Incomplete grade is not meant to create the opportunity for special or additional work for a student to raise a poor grade, or for the opportunity to take the course over by sitting in on the course in a later term without registering or paying for it. Written agreement . A written or electronic agreement will be endorsed by both the instructor and student. The document will specify a) the remaining work to be completed, b) the highest grade which may be awarded upon submission of remaining items, and c) the date which the missing work is due. The latter may not exceed one year from the end of the term for enrollment for the given course. A template \"Incomplete Contract\" is available at www.pdx.edu/registration/grading-system . Resolving the Incomplete . Instructors may not encourage students to \"sit in\" an entire future course in order to resolve the Incomplete grade. If the student needs to retake the entire course, they should be given the grade presently earned, and must formally register for the future class they will be attending. If the missed portion of the course is no longer available, instructors may offer an alternative assignment. Grading weight of the alternative assignment should not exceed the original assignment. Students are fully responsible for monitoring all due dates. Other Rules: GPA Calculation : Incomplete grades are not included when calculating GPA. Deadline for Completion : The deadline for completion of an Incomplete is one calendar year. The instructor may set a shorter deadline, which is binding. Any request for a longer deadline must be requested via petition to the Scholastic Standards Committee or Graduate Council.

If the MTM is not awarded advisors can guide students to determine if they are eligible for a CTM. Students are responsible for informing the admissions counselor or intake advisors at PSU that they are completing an MTM. It is important for students to understand that completing the MTM in two years and the bachelor's degree in four years requires them to complete a minimum average of 15 credits per quarter (or 45 credits per year). Oregon Transfer Module (OTM) Transfer students who present an earned OTM from another Oregon institution will be granted a minimum of 45 quarter credit hours toward their general education graduation requirements. Vocational and Career-Technical credits Portland State University grants up to 12 credits for courses which are deemed vocational-career technical. These credits are transferred to PSU as general elective credits. Correspondence credit A maximum of 60 correspondence credits are acceptable in transfer from regionally accredited schools recognized as institutions of higher education. Community and junior colleges The number of lower-division credits to be accepted in transfer from regionally accredited community and junior colleges is limited to 124. College courses completed before high school graduation College courses taken before a high school diploma is received are accepted in transfer provided the student receives grades of D- or above in the courses and the grades are posted on a college transcript. Health Science Professions Students who have completed preprofessional programs at PSU may transfer up to 48 credits of their professional health science work from schools accredited by a regional association and/or as indicated in Transfer Credit Practices. The health science students may not receive a bachelor's degree from PSU and from the professional school when both degrees are based essentially on the same credits completed by the student. The residence credit requirement is satisfied by completing 45 of the last 60 credits at PSU, after admission to PSU and prior to formal enrollment in the qualifying professional program. The student must be within 48 credits of receiving a bachelor's degree from PSU at the time of matriculation into the professional program.

Students spend their first two years taking lower-division courses in math, science, and engineering. At the end of their sophomore year, students apply for admission into the BSME upper-division program. Students admitted to the BSME upper-division program will be placed on one of two course plans for their junior year. These two course plans are the ME 313 First Course Plan and the ME 320 First Course Plan . These course plans are designed to maintain a healthy class size and help make sure that seats are available for newly admitted students. All juniors will complete the same courses, just in a different order, and still meet prerequisites. MECOP students are placed on the course plan that aligns with MECOP program requirements. By following the assigned course plan, a student is able to complete the BSME in four years. As a reminder, the Department requires students to complete all highlighted classes with a grade of 'C' or better, prior to applying for admission into the upper-division program. The Mechanical Engineering undergraduate degree program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org , under the General Criteria and the Mechanical and Similarly Named Engineering Criteria. Degree Maps and Learning Outcomes Program Objectives Admission requirements Mechanical Engineering B.S. Honors Track Bachelor's Plus Master's Pathway Bachelor's + Master's Pathway Bachelor's + Master's Pathway Overview The Bachelor's + Master's Pathway Program allows currently admitted BSME students to get a head-start on their master's degree. Students admitted into the Pathway Program are able to take up to 16 credit hours of approved 500-level course work as an undergraduate, at an undergraduate tuition rate*, and apply the credits to their undergraduate and graduate degrees. Admitted Pathway students have the potential to start their graduate program with 16 credits already completed. Students must apply by the third term of their junior year, and if admitted, will automatically matriculate into an MME graduate program as long as they meet the pathway continuation criteria. Students in the Pathway Program can pursue any of the MME master-level graduate programs. *Post-bac students will be charged graduate tuition rates per PSU policy. Credit Application Once Pathway students are formally admitted into an MME graduate program, the Department will request the 500-level credits taken as an undergraduate to be applied to their master's degree. Only coursework with a grade of B or higher will be applied. Students must start their master's program within one academic year of BSME graduation in order to use their pathway courses towards their master's degree. Admission Criteria Students applying to the Pathway Program must meet the following criteria: Admitted into the BSME Program Completed 10 credit hours of 300- or 400-level upper-division BSME coursework Institutional GPA of 3.3 at time of application Three letters of recommendation from faculty members (MME faculty members preferred) Statement of purpose Continuation Criteria Students must have a combined undergraduate and graduate institutional GPA of 3.3 upon graduation from the BSME program to be fully admitted into the graduate program. Application Deadline Students must apply by the end of the third term of their junior year. Applications need to be submitted by the end of finals week.", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2023-2024/bulletin/maseeh-college-of-engineering-and-computer-science/mechanical-and-materials-engineering/undergraduate-program/bachelor-s-plus-master-s-pathway", "title": "\r\n\tPortland State University\u00a0-\u00a0Bachelor's + Master's Pathway\r\n", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "College of the Arts Leroy E.

Systems engineering focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then continuing with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem. Systems engineering integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation. Many of us already practice systems engineering, but call it something else: design or development of product, process, service. This course of study will enable the engineer to function in an interdisciplinary team and apply their area of engineering specialty toward the development of a product, process, or service.

Sociologists examine groups of as small as two or as large as billions. From the smallest friendship or family group to the great global web of human activity, sociologists analyze and interpret our world. Sociologists use many theoretical approaches, data, and research techniques. Information comes from many sources including surveys, historical documents, census data, intensive interviews, and participant observation. This information is analyzed and used to explain phenomena such as power relations, beliefs and value systems, organizations, and the larger structure of society. Sociology provides valuable tools for thought and a strong foundation for careers in many fields including education, business, journalism, government, and social service. A major in sociology also prepares students for graduate programs leading to careers in research, public service, and higher education.

Sociologists examine groups of as small as two or as large as billions. From the smallest friendship or family group to the great global web of human activity, sociologists analyze and interpret our world. Sociologists use many theoretical approaches, data, and research techniques. Information comes from many sources including surveys, historical documents, census data, intensive interviews, and participant observation. This information is analyzed and used to explain phenomena such as power relations, beliefs and value systems, organizations, and the larger structure of society. Sociology provides valuable tools for thought and a strong foundation for careers in many fields including education, business, journalism, government, and social service. A major in sociology also prepares students for graduate programs leading to careers in research, public service, and higher education. Sociological knowledge helps create informed and thoughtful citizens. Degree Maps and Learning Outcomes Admission requirements Sociology B.A./B.S.

The degree program is offered through a collaboration between the Departments of Public Administration and Political Science in the Hatfield School of Government. Faculty members across the entire College of Urban and Public Affairs contribute expertise to the program as well. The curriculum focus is governance, the integrated study of political, administrative, and policy processes. This curriculum is taught against the backdrop of globalizing economies and political systems seeking to recognize governance in a modern world characterized by both cooperation and conflict among the public, private, and non-profit organizations.

Its study has made possible a modern understanding of the origin of the universe as well as the behavior of biological materials and chemical processes. Scientists trained in this field can engage in such diverse areas as solid state devices, particle physics, energy and the environment, biotechnology, and space travel. The study of physics does not involve the following of a specific recipe or set of rules; rather it entails developing an attitude or way of looking at phenomena and asking questions. Physicists seek to understand how the physical universe works, no matter what the scale of observation--from quarks to quasars, from the time it takes the proton to spin, to the age of the cosmos. The answers to these questions are summarized into statements called laws. We live in the age of physical law. Awareness of the beauty, harmony, and interplay of the laws of physics greatly enhances our view and appreciation of our environment. As an undergraduate, you will take a group of core courses that will give you a general background in the subject. You will study force and motion, heat, optics, electricity, magnetism, atomic and nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, and the physical properties of materials, learning both the theoretical and the experimental aspects. Physicists are employed by almost all industries, particularly by the technical industries and by government laboratories. Roughly half of all students with a bachelor's degree in physics go on to graduate work. In addition to a traditional graduate curriculum in physics or astronomy, they can enter programs in optics, applied physics, engineering physics, and education. Biophysics, material science, atmospheric physics, environmental science, medical physics, and finance are particularly popular fields now. Environmental programs, electrical engineering, nuclear engineering, and computer science are common graduate school tracks. Medicine and law are also fields that welcome students with physics degrees. Many physicists are entrepreneurs who start their own companies.

Selective Admission Requirements - BSCE and BSENVE For students applying for 300-level CEE course admission Terms of Admission & Deadlines Fall admission is typical to start the program. Other terms are considered on a case-by-case basis. Application is online on the CEE website . The deadline to apply is April 15. Contact the Department for additional details and consideration for special circumstances at ceedept@pdx.edu. If not a current PSU student, please apply first to PSU ( http://www.pdx.edu/admissions/ ) Minimum Requirements for Admission Complete (or have a plan to complete with spring and/or summer registrations) all required freshmen and sophomore classes on the Civil Engineering (CE) course plan or Environmental Engineering (ENVE) course plan prior to the fall term of admission. Students may be admitted if they are missing one or more of the following courses: CE students: CE 111 , CE 112 , CE 115 , CE 211 / CE 212 , up to 2 general education courses. ENVE students: CE 111 , CE 112 , CE 115 , EAS 212 , up to 2 general education courses. Earn a C or better letter grade in all required lower division courses listed under admission eligibility for the BSCE or BSENVE program. Note that Pass/No Pass grades are not accepted unless the graded option was not available at student's institution for the course. Pass grades earned spring 2020 through spring 2021 will be accepted to the program and satisfy prerequisites requirements without restriction. Selective Admission Process All students who meet the minimum admission requirements will be considered. A Selective Admission GPA will be calculated using only the required lower division courses listed under admission eligibility for the BSCE or BSENVE program. If a P/NP grade is accepted, it will not be used in the calculation. Repeated classes will be treated with standard PSU repeat/replace policy: If a student earned a D+ or below in a class the first time, then only the repeated (second) grade will be used in the Selective GPA calculation. If a student earned a C- or above in a class the first time, then both the first grade and the second (repeated) grade will be used in the Selective GPA calculation. Should a class be taken a third time it does not replace the second attempt regardless of either grade. Applicants with a Selective Admission GPA of 3.0 or above, and who are in progress to complete all required lower division courses by the fall admissions term, will be admitted. Remaining admission will be prioritized by the Selective admission GPA with the total number admitted based on available class and lab capacity. Students with low Selective Admission GPAs may be offered or required to complete the CEE Upper Division Preparation course. If required, successful completion of the Upper Division Preparation course may result in admission to the Upper Division program. Admission decisions will be communicated to the student by email. Decisions will be: Admit Admit, Recommend CEE Upper Division Preparation Course Defer, Require CEE Upper Division Preparation Course Defer, Wait for Spring or Summer Grades Deny Denied students may request a meeting with the Department Chair to review the decision. Continuation Criteria - BSCE and BSENVE After admission to the Upper Division Program, students will be expected to make satisfactory progress toward their declared degree (BSCE or BSENVE). Satisfactory progress is defined as: The term GPA in all courses taken at PSU must be 2.0 or higher. Completion of 12 credits toward the degree in an academic year. Students failing to meet (1) or (2) of the progress criteria will be placed on probation. Students will be suspended from the degree program if: The student is placed on probation for two consecutive terms or for a total of three terms. The student has not enrolled in an engineering course for three consecutive terms. Students who are suspended will not be allowed to take courses in civil or environmental engineering program for one term following suspension. Summer term is included in this calculation. Students who wish to be readmitted to the program need to schedule and attend an advising session with the Department Chair or designee. If readmitted, the suspended student will be given clear continuation criteria that may exceed the pre-suspension satisfactory progress (continuation criteria) listed above. Failure to meet the revised continuation criteria following the first suspension will result in permanent suspension from the academic program. Appeals Students may appeal department admission decisions or department continuation criteria decisions by submitting a petition to the Department Chair. The Chair's decision can be appealed to an ad-hoc departmental appeal's committee consisting of three faculty. The committee will review the appeal and communicate a written decision to the Department Chair and student. The committee's decision can be appealed to the Associate Dean of MCECS ( info@cecs.pdx.edu ).", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2023-2024/bulletin/maseeh-college-of-engineering-and-computer-science/civil-and-environmental-engineering/undergraduate-programs-bsce-and-bsenve/admissions-requirements", "title": "\r\n\tPortland State University\u00a0-\u00a0Upper Division Program Admissions Requirements\r\n", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "OHSU-PSU School of Public Health Karen Camp (2018) M.P.A.

From the smallest friendship or family group to the great global web of human activity, sociologists analyze and interpret our world. Sociologists use many theoretical approaches, data, and research techniques. Information comes from many sources including surveys, historical documents, census data, intensive interviews, and participant observation. This information is analyzed and used to explain phenomena such as power relations, beliefs and value systems, organizations, and the larger structure of society. Sociology provides valuable tools for thought and a strong foundation for careers in many fields including education, business, journalism, government, and social service. A major in sociology also prepares students for graduate programs leading to careers in research, public service, and higher education.

Its study has made possible a modern understanding of the origin of the universe as well as the behavior of biological materials and chemical processes. Scientists trained in this field can engage in such diverse areas as solid state devices, particle physics, energy and the environment, biotechnology, and space travel. The study of physics does not involve the following of a specific recipe or set of rules; rather it entails developing an attitude or way of looking at phenomena and asking questions. Physicists seek to understand how the physical universe works, no matter what the scale of observation--from quarks to quasars, from the time it takes the proton to spin, to the age of the cosmos. The answers to these questions are summarized into statements called laws. We live in the age of physical law. Awareness of the beauty, harmony, and interplay of the laws of physics greatly enhances our view and appreciation of our environment. As an undergraduate, you will take a group of core courses that will give you a general background in the subject. You will study force and motion, heat, optics, electricity, magnetism, atomic and nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, and the physical properties of materials, learning both the theoretical and the experimental aspects. Physicists are employed by almost all industries, particularly by the technical industries and by government laboratories. Roughly half of all students with a bachelor's degree in physics go on to graduate work. In addition to a traditional graduate curriculum in physics or astronomy, they can enter programs in optics, applied physics, engineering physics, and education. Biophysics, material science, atmospheric physics, environmental science, medical physics, and finance are particularly popular fields now. Environmental programs, electrical engineering, nuclear engineering, and computer science are common graduate school tracks. Medicine and law are also fields that welcome students with physics degrees. Many physicists are entrepreneurs who start their own companies.

The study of history contributes to the goals of a liberal arts education by enabling students to gain a deep appreciation of the diversity of human experience over time. Through the study of history, students learn how to interpret their own experience and to shape their own values by engaging in dialogues with the past. The study of history also nurtures the ability to view the world from multiple perspectives, including interdisciplinary ones. Finally, history provides the foundation for informed participation in both the local and the global community by teaching how to apply critical thinking skills to solving problems. The study of history offers excellent training for a variety of occupations, from teaching to law, government, business, and the arts. The Department of History encourages active engagement in historical inquiry, whether at the introductory survey level, in seminars, or in community-based learning. Active engagement requires students to learn how to master basic knowledge, ask historical questions, access and evaluate information, and communicate what they have learned in both written and oral forms. Helping students master the use of a variety of sources and tools to unlock the past is a goal of all history courses. The combined expertise of faculty in the Department of History encompasses a diversity of fields ranging from Oregon and the Pacific Northwest to World History. The department offers lower-division surveys in World History and U.S. history, but the gateway course for the major is Hst 300 Historical Imagination, which provides an introduction to the discipline--both the theory and practice--of history. Upper-division offerings include a wide range of subject areas, from the Ancient Near East to American Family History. Reading seminars (Hst 491) and research seminars (Hst 492) on specialized topics--such as medieval Spain or Japanese nationalism--provide the opportunity for majors to write a substantial research paper and to participate in intensive reading and discussion of topics. Hst 490 Comparative World History--a thematic course--is required for the major to ensure that students develop the ability to frame what they know in a world historical context and to apply comparative analysis to important historical topics. Advising is critical, because majors are encouraged to develop their own thematic, chronological, or geographical focus through their choice of upper-division elective courses. In line with the University's mission as an urban, public institution, the Department of History supports internships and partnerships with the Oregon Historical Society and other local and regional museums, archives, and historical societies and offers training in public history. All faculty consider both teaching and research, along with community service, to be part of their responsibilities as members of the Department of History. The creation of knowledge, as well as its dissemination through teaching and publication, is a vital part of the department's mission.

Professional advisors in the Health, Science, and the Earth advising pathway administer programs designed to support students' efforts to prepare for and apply to professional health programs. Pre-professional health programs at Portland State University are not majors. Rather, they are programs in which students take advantage of advising, coursework and resources all designed to support and guide students' efforts to apply to undergraduate and graduate health programs offered at other institutions. There are two types of pre-professional health programs at Portland State - 1) transfer programs, and 2) bachelor's degree programs. Transfer programs are those in which students complete a set of prerequisite courses at Portland State and then transfer to undergraduate professional health sciences programs at other institutions to complete their bachelor's degrees. The students' focus at Portland State is on fulfilling the admissions requirements of receiving institutions. Transfer programs include the following: Medical Laboratory Science Dental Hygiene Nursing Radiation Therapy Students choosing to continue at PSU, rather than pursue a pre-professional transfer program should meet with their assigned advisor within the Health, Science, & the Earth advising pathway to determine PSU graduation requirements. Bachelor's degree programs are those designed to prepare students for masters and doctoral programs in the health sciences that require or recommend completion of a bachelor's degree prior to entry. However, pre-professional bachelor's degree programs at Portland State are not majors. Thus, students must a) select a major and fulfill Portland State's graduation requirements, and b) fulfill the prerequisite coursework required by the professional graduate programs to which they plan to apply. Majors commonly selected by pre-professional health students include biology, chemistry, public health studies, science, social science and psychology. However, a student can select any major offered at Portland State, as long as they complete both Portland State's graduation requirements and those of the receiving professional institutions. Professional schools do not prefer one major over another. They do look for students who perform well in prerequisite coursework and who are broadly educated; this can be accomplished with any major. Professional health sciences programs that require or recommend that applicants earn a bachelor's degree before matriculating include the following: Allopathic and Osteopathic Medicine Chiropractic Medicine Dentistry Naturopathic Medicine Occupational Therapy Optometry Pharmacy Physical Therapy Physician Assistant Veterinary Medicine A typical pre-professional health program, whether it is a transfer or a bachelor's degree program, includes but is not limited to coursework in mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, English composition, and social science. However, coursework varies, depending on the admissions requirements of the institutions granting the professional degrees. It is essential that a student's academic program be planned with an advisor in the Health, Science, and the Earth pathway. PSU's pathway advisors work closely with students to facilitate their ability to plan coursework and activities strategically; to integrate personal, academic, and career goals; to develop the ability to evaluate options and make decisions; and to be aware of the available resources across campus that can support their efforts to gain admission to professional health sciences programs. Advisors also provide students with guidance on selecting a major, preparing for graduate admissions tests such as the MCAT and GRE, organizing letters of evaluation, and writing the personal statement for admissions applications. Postbaccalaureate Pre-Medical Program Postbaccalaureate Pre-Dental Program Postbaccalaureate Pre-Dental Program For students who already have a bachelor's degree but are lacking the specific science prerequisites for dental school, PSU offers a loosely structured postbaccalaureate program. It typically takes postbaccalaureate students who are lacking all of the science prerequisites for dental school at least two years to complete the core coursework. Courses can be planned in a variety of ways. Postbaccalaureate pre-dental students will work with their Health, Science, & the Earth pathway advisor to develop a plan for completing the pre-dental coursework as well as gain relevant experiences prior to applying to dental school. The postbaccalaureate pre-dental program is not a certificate program. Many postbaccalaureate pre-dental students do, however, complete a degree in science (science is an interdisciplinary major at Portland State) while completing prerequisite coursework for dental school. Pursuing a second degree while working on pre-professional coursework often enables postbaccalaureate students to receive financial aid for a longer period of time.

It is one of four intersectional units in the School of Gender, Race, and Nations. The Department of Black Studies is devoted to the exploration and analysis of all aspects of African people and people of African descent in the United States, the Caribbean/Latin America, and Europe. It seeks to research and teach about the Black experience through the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary contributions of its faculty by providing comprehensive learning programs aimed at greater understanding of the historical and contemporary experiences of people in Africa and African descended people across the Americas, the Caribbean, Oceania, Asia, and Europe. The Department of Black Studies provides students who opt for the Black Studies major, minor, certificate, or as an addition to majors such as Anthropology, English, Sociology, Community Studies, History, etc., a variety of course offerings. These courses serve to expand students' breadth of knowledge in related courses offered by the department or as a complement to those in other departments. Students gain an understanding of the complex relationships across and between race/racism, gender/sexism, sexuality/homophobia, class differences and inequalities. The Department of Black Studies incorporates in its understandings and analysis of Black Life cultural themes such as music, literature, and film; institutions like the family, religion, housing, employment, criminal injustice system and health care; and the more general realms of culture and political economy into its curriculum and its courses. The program provides students with a general historical background of the Black experience in Africa and the Western hemisphere, as well as locally. Students also examine contemporary inter- and intra-racial/ethnic dynamics and are encouraged to engage in study and/or civic engagement courses to support their interests in global and community studies. The Department of Black Studies prepares students to work with African, Black or African American communities and to apply for graduate studies in a variety of disciplinary and professional programs. It will also give students a crucial competitive advantage in obtaining careers in those areas and within communities that interact with African, African American, Afro-Asiatic, Afro-Oceanic, and Caribbean/Latin American cultures. Students interested in any of the degree programs offered in the Department of Black Studies are strongly encouraged to enroll in BST 202: Introduction to Black Studies or any other 200-level course. Students should meet with the undergraduate advisor for assistance with course selection based on their interests.

Its fields include metaphysics (ultimate nature of reality), epistemology (nature of knowledge and reasoning), and ethics (principles of moral obligation). Through the study of the Philosophy Department's curriculum, students learn about the historical traditions and contemporary theories in these fields. Philosophy also examines the basic concepts, principles, and arguments of the major scientific and intellectual disciplines concerned with the study of domains of reality, features and practices of knowledge, and social values and arrangements. These topics are addressed in areas such as philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion. The study of philosophy enriches students' lives as metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical reflection is essential to individual development and cultures across time and place. Moreover, philosophy enhances skills of abstract thinking, clear argumentative writing, careful reading and analysis of texts, and oral argument. Philosophical training is then valuable in almost any area of life and any occupation that requires examination and analysis of problems, critical evaluation of alternative solutions, and rational advocacy of conclusions and courses of action. Philosophy is also an excellent undergraduate major for pre-professional students: philosophy majors outscore all other majors on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE's) and receive scores among the highest on the LSAT's, GMAT's, and MCAT's. It is ideal for those who aspire to work in the legal profession and fitting for students planning careers in medicine.

Coursework emphasizes systematic and regional approaches to understanding the physical environment and human-environment interactions. Techniques classes (in GIS, remote sensing, cartography, and spatial analysis) provide the tools to analyze complex local, regional, and global phenomena. Access to the Pacific Coast and the Cascade Mountains provides ample opportunity for fieldwork-based classes and opportunities for research. The PSU Department of Geography is an excellent choice for undergraduate and graduate students with interests in the linkages between human and natural systems. Faculty engage in local, regional, and international research projects in hydrology, water resources, biogeography, geomorphology, sustainable development, land use analysis, climate change, cultural and political ecology, cultural landscapes, the urban environment, geographic education, and geographic information science. Ongoing faculty research sites in international areas include Patagonia, the Amazon Basin, Sub-saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Pacific Rim. Geography participates in the Earth, Environment and Society (EES) Ph.D. Program. Over 120 undergraduate majors and 30 graduate students participate in two departmental groups, the Friends of Geography and the Student Chapter of the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing/Columbia River Region. Several research groups and outreach programs in the department provide additional job and internship opportunities for interested students in public agencies and businesses in such fields as planning, environmental management, GIS, and cartography. The geography program gives students an appreciation and understanding of the human environment on global, regional, and local scales. It provides background and requisite training for careers in resource, planning, environmental, or education fields. Geography majors find work in urban and natural resource management, spatial/GIS analysis, urban planning, map design and production, and statistical analysis. Geography is the lead department on campus for training in GIS, remote sensing, cartography, and spatial analysis. Degree Maps and Learning Outcomes Admission requirements Geography B.A./B.S.

The study of history contributes to the goals of a liberal arts education by enabling students to gain a deep appreciation of the diversity of human experience over time. Through the study of history, students learn how to interpret their own experience and to shape their own values by engaging in dialogues with the past. The study of history also nurtures the ability to view the world from multiple perspectives, including interdisciplinary ones. Finally, history provides the foundation for informed participation in both the local and the global community by teaching how to apply critical thinking skills to solving problems. The study of history offers excellent training for a variety of occupations, from teaching to law, government, business, and the arts. The Department of History encourages active engagement in historical inquiry, whether at the introductory survey level, in seminars, or in community-based learning. Active engagement requires students to learn how to master basic knowledge, ask historical questions, access and evaluate information, and communicate what they have learned in both written and oral forms. Helping students master the use of a variety of sources and tools to unlock the past is a goal of all history courses. The combined expertise of faculty in the Department of History encompasses a diversity of fields ranging from Oregon and the Pacific Northwest to World History. The department offers lower-division surveys in World History and U.S. history, but the gateway course for the major is Hst 300 Historical Imagination, which provides an introduction to the discipline--both the theory and practice--of history. Upper-division offerings include a wide range of subject areas, from the Ancient Near East to American Family History. Reading seminars (Hst 491) and research seminars (Hst 492) on specialized topics--such as medieval Spain or Japanese nationalism--provide the opportunity for majors to write a substantial research paper and to participate in intensive reading and discussion of topics. Hst 490 Comparative World History--a thematic course--is required for the major to ensure that students develop the ability to frame what they know in a world historical context and to apply comparative analysis to important historical topics. Advising is critical, because majors are encouraged to develop their own thematic, chronological, or geographical focus through their choice of upper-division elective courses. In line with the University's mission as an urban, public institution, the Department of History supports internships and partnerships with the Oregon Historical Society and other local and regional museums, archives, and historical societies and offers training in public history. All faculty consider both teaching and research, along with community service, to be part of their responsibilities as members of the Department of History. The creation of knowledge, as well as its dissemination through teaching and publication, is a vital part of the department's mission.

CHLA seeks to explore Chicanx/Latinx experiences through an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach to center the lived experiences and the production of knowledge of Chicanx/Latinx communities. Faculty examine how race, ethnicity, language, sexuality, gender, and other social identities intersect in Chicanx/Latinx communities and within the larger U.S. landscape. At its core, CHLA employs a decolonial, anti-racist, anti-sexist, framework to challenge centuries of white supremacy, settler colonialism, and other systems of oppression that have impacted how Chicanx/Latinx communities live, work, create, and thrive. Graduates with a degree, minor, or certificate in Chicano/Latino studies will have augmented their major field of study by broadening their scope of knowledge. They will have gained important insight into a very different culture within U.S. borders. This increased awareness and insight will lead to successful interaction on many levels of society. Graduates also will be better prepared to enter the workforce with its rapidly changing demographics.

The study of history contributes to the goals of a liberal arts education by enabling students to gain a deep appreciation of the diversity of human experience over time. Through the study of history, students learn how to interpret their own experience and to shape their own values by engaging in dialogues with the past. The study of history also nurtures the ability to view the world from multiple perspectives, including interdisciplinary ones. Finally, history provides the foundation for informed participation in both the local and the global community by teaching how to apply critical thinking skills to solving problems. The study of history offers excellent training for a variety of occupations, from teaching to law, government, business, and the arts. The Department of History encourages active engagement in historical inquiry, whether at the introductory survey level, in seminars, or in community-based learning. Active engagement requires students to learn how to master basic knowledge, ask historical questions, access and evaluate information, and communicate what they have learned in both written and oral forms. Helping students master the use of a variety of sources and tools to unlock the past is a goal of all history courses. The combined expertise of faculty in the Department of History encompasses a diversity of fields ranging from Oregon and the Pacific Northwest to World History. The department offers lower-division surveys in World History and U.S. history, but the gateway course for the major is Hst 300 Historical Imagination, which provides an introduction to the discipline--both the theory and practice--of history. Upper-division offerings include a wide range of subject areas, from the Ancient Near East to American Family History. Reading seminars ( Hst 491 ) and research seminars ( Hst 492 ) on specialized topics--such as medieval Spain or Japanese nationalism--provide the opportunity for majors to write a substantial research paper and to participate in intensive reading and discussion of topics. Hst 490 Comparative World History--a thematic course--is required for the major to ensure that students develop the ability to frame what they know in a world historical context and to apply comparative analysis to important historical topics. Advising is critical, because majors are encouraged to develop their own thematic, chronological, or geographical focus through their choice of upper-division elective courses. In line with the University's mission as an urban, public institution, the Department of History supports internships and partnerships with the Oregon Historical Society and other local and regional museums, archives, and historical societies and offers training in public history. All faculty consider both teaching and research, along with community service, to be part of their responsibilities as members of the Department of History. The creation of knowledge, as well as its dissemination through teaching and publication, is a vital part of the department's mission.

The program is designed to give the student a graduate level of competence in general anthropology, including the major subfields of biological anthropology, archaeology, and social-cultural anthropology. At the same time, the program permits the student to pursue a special interest in one of the subfields. Students have the option of choosing from three tracks: a thesis track, an internship track, or a skills track. The thesis track candidate is required to do research in an area of special interest and prepare a thesis based upon it. The internship and skills tracks are designed to prepare students for professional employment related to applied anthropology. Students in the internship track will complete an internship and a thesis that combines an internship deliverable and a final internship paper. Students in the skills track will take 7 additional hours of coursework, complete comprehensive exams, and submit a portfolio that documents the skills they obtained during the program. For more information, interested students are urged to go to the Department's Web site: www.pdx.edu/anthropology . The master's program has been planned for students who hold an undergraduate degree in general anthropology or its equivalent in course coverage. For students with this preparation, the master's degree, including research and thesis, may be completed in two to three years. Graduate applicants who lack an undergraduate major in Anthropology may be admitted to the program, but completion of the degree may require a more extended period of study. Students without an adequate background in anthropology will be required to take selected undergraduate courses to remove deficiencies. These courses normally do not offer graduate credit.

Its fields include metaphysics (ultimate nature of reality), epistemology (nature of knowledge and reasoning), and ethics (principles of moral obligation). Through the study of the Philosophy Department's curriculum, students learn about the historical traditions and contemporary theories in these fields. Philosophy also examines the basic concepts, principles, and arguments of the major scientific and intellectual disciplines concerned with the study of domains of reality, features and practices of knowledge, and social values and arrangements. These topics are addressed in areas such as philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion. The study of philosophy enriches students' lives as metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical reflection is essential to individual development and cultures across time and place. Moreover, philosophy enhances skills of abstract thinking, clear argumentative writing, careful reading and analysis of texts, and oral argument. Philosophical training is then valuable in almost any area of life and any occupation that requires examination and analysis of problems, critical evaluation of alternative solutions, and rational advocacy of conclusions and courses of action. Philosophy is also an excellent undergraduate major for pre-professional students: philosophy majors outscore all other majors on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE's) and receive scores among the highest on the LSAT's, GMAT's, and MCAT's. It is ideal for those who aspire to work in the legal profession and fitting for students planning careers in medicine. And finally, as the quintessential interdisciplinary course of study, philosophy is a wonderful second-major and compliments the course of study in the physical and social sciences, arts, and humanities.

Its study has made possible a modern understanding of the origin of the universe as well as the behavior of biological materials and chemical processes. Scientists trained in this field can engage in such diverse areas as solid state devices, particle physics, energy and the environment, biotechnology, and space travel. The study of physics does not involve the following of a specific recipe or set of rules; rather it entails developing an attitude or way of looking at phenomena and asking questions. Physicists seek to understand how the physical universe works, no matter what the scale of observation--from quarks to quasars, from the time it takes the proton to spin, to the age of the cosmos. The answers to these questions are summarized into statements called laws. We live in the age of physical law. Awareness of the beauty, harmony, and interplay of the laws of physics greatly enhances our view and appreciation of our environment. As an undergraduate, you will take a group of core courses that will give you a general background in the subject. You will study force and motion, heat, optics, electricity, magnetism, atomic and nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, and the physical properties of materials, learning both the theoretical and the experimental aspects. Physicists are employed by almost all industries, particularly by the technical industries and by government laboratories. Roughly half of all students with a bachelor's degree in physics go on to graduate work. In addition to a traditional graduate curriculum in physics or astronomy, they can enter programs in optics, applied physics, engineering physics, and education. Biophysics, material science, atmospheric physics, environmental science, medical physics, and finance are particularly popular fields now. Environmental programs, electrical engineering, nuclear engineering, and computer science are common graduate school tracks. Medicine and law are also fields that welcome students with physics degrees. Many physicists are entrepreneurs who start their own companies.

Planning focuses on the development and implementation of mechanisms for organizing social, economic, political, and environmental change at the local, state, and regional levels. The field includes study of the relationships and interactions among public and private institutions, organizations, citizens, and landscapes; the design of processes for facilitating dialogue among public actors; and the tools for planning analysis and evaluation. As a pioneer in state land use law and a place in which planning discourse is highly visible, Oregon provides a rare vantage point for the study of planning history, planning processes and strategies, and professional practice. Environment focuses on urban socio-ecological conditions and interactions in areas such as natural resource management, environmental protection and quality, ecosystem services, food systems, and energy and climate. This includes a foundation in theory and methods that enable: examination of the roles of institutions (both government and non-government), groups and individuals, law and regulation, ethics and values, the market (or lack of a market); the handling of usable knowledge and scientific uncertainty; and the analysis of change in complex socio-technical-biophysical systems. Community development deals with the dynamics of neighborhood and community formation and change and with public policies that address the needs of groups and places within contemporary society. The rich civic culture of Portland and the Pacific Northwest and the region's connections to the Pacific Rim provide numerous examples for study and analysis. Within the broad field of community development, students can address such topics as ethnic and neighborhood history, housing and economic development, the roles of public and nonprofit institutions in community building, mediation and conflict resolution, changing patterns and systems of communication, and the changing meanings of place. Social demography provides training in the tools of demographic analysis, with particular attention to the methods of data collection, techniques of demographic analysis, and the interpretation of research findings. Social demography involves the use of the principles and methods of demography in decision-making and planning problems in both public and private settings. Graduates in the field of social demography use demographic data to identify and analyze important population trends and their consequences for work in government agencies, research organizations, and corporations. Faculty in the area of social demography have training in demography, sociology, geography, and statistics. Faculty research includes population distribution and migration, international migration, fertility and family planning, marriage and divorce, public policy uses of demographic data and estimates, and demographic methods. Gerontology addresses the social issues, problems, policies, and programs that affect the quality of life for our rapidly aging population. Students have the opportunity to work directly with faculty on publicly- and privately-funded research at the College's highly regarded Institute on Aging. Adult development and aging is approached from a multidisciplinary and collaborative perspective. Faculty research interests include: family caregiving and work-family balance, social networks and widowhood, diversity in aging, long-term care policy and programs, housing environments, development and evaluation of training for health professionals, and planning for the aging of the baby-boom generation and beyond. As a state with a national reputation as a leader in the development of community-based, long-term care, Oregon provides a unique environment for the study of aging processes, policies, and services. Economic development is concerned with the factors that lead to differential rates of economic development at various spatial scales: within and between nations, states, regions, cities, and neighborhoods. In analyzing these differences, issues such as the meaning of economic development, who gains and who loses from various changes, as well as analysis of policies to promote economic development, are addressed. The Center for Urban Studies and Institute for Portland Metropolitan Studies offer research opportunities in this field. Transportation includes planning, policy, forecasting, measurement, and evaluation of multimodal transportation infrastructure and systems. The multidisciplinary field covers all modes of passenger and freight transport and includes the holistic study of relationships and interactions of the transportation systems with land use, the region, the economy, the environment, institutions, the community, and people. Students can address topics such as impacts of transportation on land use and land values, the relationships between urban form and travel behavior, the costs and benefits of transport facilities, the operation of transportation facilities, equity impacts of transport and the effects of transportation plans and policies. There are opportunities to work on research through the Center for Urban Studies and the Center for Transportation Studies. Each student pursues two fields of specialization, at least one of which should be chosen from among those listed above. A student-nominated field, developed in conjunction with School faculty, may be offered as a second specialization. Faculty groups specify field-specific course requirements, including methodology courses and courses essential to a multidisciplinary approach. These groups work closely with students to develop coherent specializations that prepare each individual to do doctoral-level research in that field.", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2023-2024/bulletin/college-of-urban-and-public-affairs/nohad-a-toulan-school-of-urban-studies-and-planning/graduate-programs/urban-studies-ph-d", "title": "\r\n\tPortland State University\u00a0-\u00a0Urban Studies Ph.D. (Not accepting new students)\r\n", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "USP 697 Research Design 2 Research seminar required for students in urban studies doctoral program; open to MUS and other advanced graduate students.

Its fields include metaphysics (ultimate nature of reality), epistemology (nature of knowledge and reasoning), and ethics (principles of moral obligation). Through the study of the Philosophy Department's curriculum, students learn about the historical traditions and contemporary theories in these fields. Philosophy also examines the basic concepts, principles, and arguments of the major scientific and intellectual disciplines concerned with the study of domains of reality, features and practices of knowledge, and social values and arrangements. These topics are addressed in areas such as philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion. The study of philosophy enriches students' lives as metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical reflection is essential to individual development and cultures across time and place. Moreover, philosophy enhances skills of abstract thinking, clear argumentative writing, careful reading and analysis of texts, and oral argument. Philosophical training is then valuable in almost any area of life and any occupation that requires examination and analysis of problems, critical evaluation of alternative solutions, and rational advocacy of conclusions and courses of action. Philosophy is also an excellent undergraduate major for pre-professional students: philosophy majors outscore all other majors on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE's) and receive scores among the highest on the LSAT's, GMAT's, and MCAT's. It is ideal for those who aspire to work in the legal profession and fitting for students planning careers in medicine. And finally, as the quintessential interdisciplinary course of study, philosophy is a wonderful second-major and compliments the course of study in the physical and social sciences, arts, and humanities.

Professional advisors in the Health, Science, and the Earth advising pathway administer programs designed to support students' efforts to prepare for and apply to professional health programs. Pre-professional health programs at Portland State University are not majors. Rather, they are programs in which students take advantage of advising, coursework and resources all designed to support and guide students' efforts to apply to undergraduate and graduate health programs offered at other institutions. There are two types of pre-professional health programs at Portland State - 1) transfer programs, and 2) bachelor's degree programs. Transfer programs are those in which students complete a set of prerequisite courses at Portland State and then transfer to undergraduate professional health sciences programs at other institutions to complete their bachelor's degrees. The students' focus at Portland State is on fulfilling the admissions requirements of receiving institutions. Transfer programs include the following: Medical Laboratory Science Dental Hygiene Nursing Radiation Therapy Students choosing to continue at PSU, rather than pursue a pre-professional transfer program should meet with their assigned advisor within the Health, Science, & the Earth advising pathway to determine PSU graduation requirements. Bachelor's degree programs are those designed to prepare students for masters and doctoral programs in the health sciences that require or recommend completion of a bachelor's degree prior to entry. However, pre-professional bachelor's degree programs at Portland State are not majors. Thus, students must a) select a major and fulfill Portland State's graduation requirements, and b) fulfill the prerequisite coursework required by the professional graduate programs to which they plan to apply. Majors commonly selected by pre-professional health students include biology, chemistry, public health studies, science, social science and psychology. However, a student can select any major offered at Portland State, as long as they complete both Portland State's graduation requirements and those of the receiving professional institutions. Professional schools do not prefer one major over another. They do look for students who perform well in prerequisite coursework and who are broadly educated; this can be accomplished with any major. Professional health sciences programs that require or recommend that applicants earn a bachelor's degree before matriculating include the following: Allopathic and Osteopathic Medicine Chiropractic Medicine Dentistry Naturopathic Medicine Occupational Therapy Optometry Pharmacy Physical Therapy Physician Assistant Veterinary Medicine A typical pre-professional health program, whether it is a transfer or a bachelor's degree program, includes but is not limited to coursework in mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, English composition, and social science. However, coursework varies, depending on the admissions requirements of the institutions granting the professional degrees. It is essential that a student's academic program be planned with an advisor in the Health, Science, and the Earth pathway. PSU's pathway advisors work closely with students to facilitate their ability to plan coursework and activities strategically; to integrate personal, academic, and career goals; to develop the ability to evaluate options and make decisions; and to be aware of the available resources across campus that can support their efforts to gain admission to professional health sciences programs. Advisors also provide students with guidance on selecting a major, preparing for graduate admissions tests such as the MCAT and GRE, organizing letters of evaluation, and writing the personal statement for admissions applications. Postbaccalaureate Pre-Medical Program Postbaccalaureate Pre-Dental Program Postbaccalaureate Pre-Medical Program For students who already have a bachelor's degree but are lacking the specific science prerequisites for medical school, PSU offers a loosely structured postbaccalaureate program. The timeline for completion varies based on the individual student's previous preparation. At least two years is a common timeline for those without significant prior coursework in the sciences. The two year timeline allows for a balanced (though still challenging) schedule as well as more time to gain clinical exposure, demonstrate long-term service in the field, and include study time for the MCAT. Coursework may include year-long sequences in general chemistry, biology, organic chemistry, and physics, as well as single term courses in genetics and biochemistry. It is possible to further expedite the completion of pre-med courses with previous math coursework or utilizing summer accelerated sequences. Postbac students will work with their Health, Science, & the Earth pathway advisor to determine a course plan that works best with their goals. The postbaccalaureate pre-medical program is not a certificate program. Many postbaccalaureate pre-medical students do, however, complete a degree in science (science is an interdisciplinary major at Portland State) while completing prerequisite coursework for medical school. Most students need only add two to three classes to the pre-medical coursework in order to finish the degree. Pursuing a second degree while working on pre-professional coursework often enables postbaccalaureate students to receive financial aid for a longer period of time. For more information, contact an advisor in the Health, Science, and Earth advising pathway.", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2023-2024/bulletin/college-of-liberal-arts-and-sciences/pre-professional-programs/pre-professional-health-programs/postbaccalaureate-pre-medical-program", "title": "\r\n\tPortland State University\u00a0-\u00a0Postbaccalaureate Pre-Medical Program\r\n", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Licensure In Oregon, educator candidates become eligible for a state educator license by completing coursework, student teaching and assessments, used to determine their status as program completers.

Coursework emphasizes systematic and regional approaches to understanding the physical environment and human-environment interactions. Techniques classes (in GIS, remote sensing, cartography, and spatial analysis) provide the tools to analyze complex local, regional, and global phenomena. Access to the Pacific Coast and the Cascade Mountains provides ample opportunity for fieldwork-based classes and opportunities for research. The PSU Department of Geography is an excellent choice for undergraduate and graduate students with interests in the linkages between human and natural systems. Faculty engage in local, regional, and international research projects in hydrology, water resources, biogeography, geomorphology, sustainable development, land use analysis, climate change, cultural and political ecology, cultural landscapes, the urban environment, geographic education, and geographic information science. Ongoing faculty research sites in international areas include Patagonia, the Amazon Basin, Sub-saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Pacific Rim. Geography participates in the Earth, Environment and Society (EES) Ph.D. Program. Over 120 undergraduate majors and 30 graduate students participate in two departmental groups, the Friends of Geography and the Student Chapter of the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing/Columbia River Region. Several research groups and outreach programs in the department provide additional job and internship opportunities for interested students in public agencies and businesses in such fields as planning, environmental management, GIS, and cartography. The geography program gives students an appreciation and understanding of the human environment on global, regional, and local scales. It provides background and requisite training for careers in resource, planning, environmental, or education fields. Geography majors find work in urban and natural resource management, spatial/GIS analysis, urban planning, map design and production, and statistical analysis. Geography is the lead department on campus for training in GIS, remote sensing, cartography, and spatial analysis. Degree Maps and Learning Outcomes Admission requirements Geography B.A./B.S.

While all graduate students are required to complete a foundational curriculum of courses in political science theory, research, and presenting social science, the program intentionally allows for a great deal of flexibility. Students can tailor their elective coursework according to their particular interests and goals, and even substitute internships for credit during their second year. This allows the program to work equally well for students who are seriously contemplating the pursuit of a doctoral degree in political science as well as those interested in careers in law, legislative affairs, or the foreign service. The Department also participates in the Master of Public Policy program and the Public Affairs and Policy Ph.D. program . Admission requirements Political Science M.S. Admission requirements The master's program generally attracts students with undergraduate degrees in political science, but is open to students with a wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The program admits graduate students during the fall term. Procedures and deadlines for applications are provided on the program website . The following materials should be submitted through the application link found on the Graduate School's website . Non-refundable $65 application fee, if not eligible for a waiver; One transcript from each post-secondary institution attended, including a certified English translation if necessary for international applicants ( See more information about transcripts ); A 500-word statement of intent.

Once all criteria are met, candidates can then be recommended to Teacher Standards and Practices Commission (TPSC) for an educator license. Assessments during a program include subject matter test(s), and a nationally-scored assessment, edTPA.. For information on Oregon testing requirements please refer to the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission website . Tools of multiple measure are available to programs to assist candidates for whom tests or assessments present a barrier to program completion. Currently, the teacher licensure programs in the COE have processes for utilizing the multiple measures tools which were developed by TSPC.

Managing R&D projects, technological systems, technical organizations and resources, and other professionals requires management knowledge and skills. Engineers and scientists are faced with these challenges very early in their careers. Typically, within three to seven years after graduation, they find themselves addressing complex issues which necessitate that they play two roles simultaneously: the role of the specialist and the manager of technology. Those who choose the management path start moving toward management responsibilities while maintaining identity in their technical backgrounds - the Department of Engineering and Technology Management (ETM) has been designed for them. The Department of Engineering and Technology Management addresses the needs of engineers and scientists whose objective is to advance to technical management positions in business, industry, or government. We also address the needs of those wishing to continue their engineering/technology management research-based studies while pursuing careers at either academic institutions or R&D organizations.

(Fully Online Available) Minor (Fully Online Available) Postbaccalaureate Certificate (Fully Online Available) M.S. The Department of Criminology & Criminal Justice emphasizes the generation and practical application of empirical evidence to crime and justice issues. We seek to promote effectiveness, efficiency, and equity in crime prevention and control efforts by (1) providing students with quality educational experiences that prepare them for lifelong professional success, (2) conducting and disseminating research on theoretical and policy-relevant topics, and (3) collaborating with justice-related organizations to assess, evaluate, and improve policy and practice. Our Department values empirical inquiry, access to higher education, diversity, social justice, and community engagement. Undergraduate Program The Department of Criminology & Criminal Justice offers both a campus-based and fully online pathway toward its bachelor degree. The undergraduate program seeks to educate students about the causes, consequences, prevention, and control of criminal and law-violating activity at multiple levels of analysis. Our undergraduate curriculum focuses on (1) criminology and criminal justice theories and empirical research addressing the role of individuals, families, communities, and society in the production and prevention of crime, (2) the justice system's function in controlling crime, and (3) a critical analysis of the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of related policies and practices. Educational experiences facilitated inside and outside of class help promote students' long term professional success by developing their capacity for critical reasoning, problem-solving, and effective communication. Criminology & Criminal Justice is an interdisciplinary major, a fact demonstrated by the diverse backgrounds of our full-time and part-time faculty. Students graduating from our program have a wide range of choices when they look for employment or post-graduate education. Recent graduates have found jobs in law enforcement (e.g., police officer, immigration, crime analyst), courts (e.g., victim advocate, administration), corrections (e.g., parole officer, facility management), human services (e.g., offender counseling, child welfare), and crime prevention (e.g., neighborhood crime prevention specialist, private security). Other alumni from our program have gone on to pursue advanced degrees in such areas as law, criminal justice, psychology, social work, public administration, and urban planning.

In addition, the following number system is generally in effect in all Oregon public institutions: 100 to 110 and 200 to 210 courses are survey or foundation courses in the liberal arts and sciences in the disciplines covered. The following numbered courses are repeating courses (they may be taken for more than one term under the same number), with credit being granted according to the amount of work done: 199, 299, 399, Special Studies; 401, 501, 601, 801, Research; 402, 502, 602, 802, Independent Study; 403 Thesis/Honors Thesis; 503 Thesis/603 Dissertation; 404, 504, 604, 804, Cooperative Education/Internship; 405, 505, 605, 805, Reading and Conference; 406, 506, 606, 806, Problems/Projects; 407, 507, 607, 807, Seminar; 408, 508, 608, 808, Workshop; 409, 509, 609, 809, Practicum; 410, 510, 610, 810, Selected Topics. Other repeating numbers are assigned to activity courses, such as art, music, and physical education. Certain senior level courses are taught concurrently with their graduate-level counterparts. Hence this course may be offered for either graduate or undergraduate credit. (See quarterly Schedule of Classes for specific offering.) In the graduate credit course, additional work appropriate to the graduate level of study will be assigned. Oregon Common Course Numbers The state of Oregon has identified a set of commonly transferred lower division courses across all public higher education institutions which are to be part of a Common Course Numbering system. These courses have aligned course numbers, learning outcomes, credit hours, course titles and descriptions.

Learn more about student records privacy online at www.pdx.edu/registration/student-records-privacy-policy . Documents Submitted to the University All documents, including transcripts, submitted to PSU become the property of the University and are not intended for duplication or return to the student. Academic Record Sealed After Degree Earned Portland State University academic records are sealed thirty days after the conferral of a degree. After this date, changes to majors and minors, addition of departmental honors, removal of incomplete grades, grade changes, changes to degree posting, or other changes to an academic record cannot be made except by decision of the Scholastic Standards Committee or the Graduate Council. Academic Credit Academic Credit Hour Policy This credit hour definition is based on the traditional Carnegie unit and aligns with the Federal financial aid definition mandated by the United States Department of Education's (USDE) regulations [34 CFR 600.02 and 668.8, effective July 1, 2020] and the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) standards and policies. As the basic unit of measurement of educational accomplishment the credit hour is used to measure student progress toward a degree, which in turn enables PSU's programs to be eligible for Title IV Financial Aid programs under the Higher Education Act. These definitions rely on the '50-minute' credit hour when considering in-class meeting times. The PSU standard class scheduling time grid provides sufficient in-class time for both 3 and 4 credit classes. PSU Definition: The credit hour is conceptually framed as an amount of student work (i.e. a reasonable approximation of the total time commitment required of the typical student) associated with achieving intended learning outcomes. Under PSU's quarter system, one academic credit is given for a minimum of 30 hours of student work over the term (i.e. a 1:30 ratio over the term). If the course meets regularly for 10 weeks, then 1 credit would require a minimum of 3 hours of student time per week for the 10 week term (i.e. a 1:3 ratio per week for 10 weeks). For a standard lecture/seminar class section with synchronous meetings, a minimum of 1 hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of 2 hours of out-of-class student work is required per week for a 10 week instructional term (1:3), or an equivalent amount of work distributed over a different time period (1:30). For other credit-bearing activities - such as labs, internships, practica, studio work, projects, mentor sessions - 1 credit requires at least an equivalent amount of student work spread out over the term (i.e. 1:30 ratio). Important Note: The policy sets the minimum level of student work/time required per credit, not an upper limit. The standards for the amount of student work per credit can vary greatly by academic unit. Each academic unit determines the structure of such courses and the credit hour ratio, based on variations in commonly accepted disciplinary and accreditation standards/practice within postsecondary education. Student work includes time spent in: Direct Instruction, where the core/primary course content is delivered, typically by faculty during synchronous class meetings, but also includes guided learning through core material via asynchronous online delivery, Outside of Class study time, reading assignments, homework, papers, group work, exam preparation, etc., and Other Academic Activities which include credit and non-credit bearing course sections designed to review, discuss, practice or apply the course (and program) concepts delivered via direct instruction. Other Academic Activities include the following course types: laboratory, internships, practica, studio, projects, and other supplemental support sections like mentored inquiry. Alternative Delivery Formats - Hybrid, Online - No Scheduled Meetings, Partial Term Classes that do not use synchronous meeting/contact times (for example, hybrid or asynchronous online courses) - or only meet for a partial term (i.e. for fewer than the standard 10 weeks) - will meet the credit hour standard if the course content and outcomes cover the same material in the same depth as a standard 10-week synchronous version of the same course, and the amount of student work is the same. Regardless of the length of the course or the amount of time spent in synchronous learning, the course learning outcomes, subject matter/content covered, and amount of student work must be equivalent to the amount of work/learning associated with the standard 10-week course. Transferring Credit Hours PSU is on the quarter-system calendar and all credit hours listed in the PSU Bulletin and schedule of classes refer to quarter credits. Semester credits transferred to PSU from other accredited United States schools may be converted to PSU's credits by multiplying by 1.5 (e.g., 3 semester hours x 1.5 = 4.5 quarter credits). The 1.5 multiplication rule applies only to semester credits transferred from regionally accredited U.S. schools. Credits transferred from accredited schools outside the United States will be converted according to established international transfer credit guidelines and policies. PSU credits transferred out to a semester system institution may be converted by multiplying the number of quarter credits by .67 to determine the semester hour equivalent (e.g., 4 quarter credits x .67 = 2.68 semester credits). NWCCU Considerations In accordance with the NWCCU policy, PSU faculty will determine the amount of work associated with a credit hour, by considering learning outcomes and by accounting for a variety of delivery methods, measurements of student work, academic calendars, disciplines, degree levels, and commonly established standards/practices within postsecondary education. PSU periodically reviews the application of its policy on credit hours across the institution to assure that credit hour assignments are accurate, fair, equitable and reliable across degree levels, academic disciplines, delivery modes, and types of academic activities. Academic Credit Overload Undergraduate Academic Credit Overload Undergraduate students who enroll in more than 21 credits per term are considered to be in academic overload. PSU audit credits and transfer credit taken at other institutions while concurrently enrolled at PSU are counted in determining overload status. Transfer credits that result in an overload for a given term will not be accepted in transfer unless prior approval has been granted. Academic overload must be approved on a term-by-term basis as follows: 22-25 credits: Students must obtain prior approval from their academic program adviser using the Overload Approval Form, to be submitted to the Office of the Registrar in advance of the overload term. 26 or more credits: Students must obtain prior permission from the Academic Requirements Committee (ARC) by submitting an ARC petition in advance of the overload term. Students must provide justification for the overload and obtain written support from their academic program adviser. Petitions must be submitted using the Academic Requirements Committee petition prior to the first day of the overload term. Graduate Academic Credit Overload Graduate students must obtain approval for registration in excess of 16 credits (graduate and undergraduate credits combined) via the Overload Approval form. A student registering for 17 to 19 credits must obtain the approval from their department chair or faculty adviser. A student registering for 20 credits or more must obtain the approval of their department chair and the Graduate School. A graduate assistant registering for more than 16 credits must obtain approval from their department chair and the Graduate School. Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering graduate students have a lower maximum registration limit of 10 credits. These students must obtain approval to register for 11 or more credits via the Overload Approval form. Class standing Class standing is based on the number of credits a student has completed, according to the following schedule: Class Standing Credits Completed Freshman 1-44 Sophomore 45-89 Upper-division standing 90 or more Junior 90-134 Senior 135 or more Postbaccalaureate Hold an undergraduate degree from an accredited college or university Appeals and Grievances Grievances and requests for exceptions to University policies and requirements may be filed with specific committees authorized to deal with specific student concerns. Academic Appeals Board This board hears appeals from students who claim to have received prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation and makes recommendations on cases to the Provost. In such cases the student should first consult with the instructor. If the grievance is not resolved, the student should then contact the department chair, then the dean of the college or school. If the grievance is still not resolved, the student may then appeal by writing a letter to the Academic Appeals Board. Appeals may be filed in the Office of Dean of Student Life, 433 Smith Memorial Student Union. Academic Requirements Committee (ARC) The ARC is a subcommittee of the PSU Faculty Senate and is responsible for developing policies and adjudicating petitions regarding academic regulations related to credit loads, transfer credit, degree and certificate requirements for all undergraduate programs. It also develops and recommends policies and adjudicates student petitions regarding initial undergraduate admissions, including entering freshmen. The ARC Petition process is managed by an online process accessed at www.pdx.edu.registration/academic-requirements-committee-petitions . Deadline Appeals Committee (DAC) A student may petition this committee to be exempted from published registration deadlines for the current term when mitigating circumstances prevent deadline compliance. Petitions must include documentation of the reason for missing the deadline. The petition may be accessed at www.pdx.edu/registration/dac . For further information students may call 503-725-3220. Scholastic Standards Committee (SSC) The SSC is a Faculty Senate committee charged with developing and recommending academic standards to maintain the integrity of the undergraduate program and academic transcripts of the University; developing, maintaining and implementing protocols regarding academic changes to the undergraduate transcript; reviewing and ruling on petitions for any retroactive change to the academic record such as a grade option change, drop, add, and extension of an incomplete beyond the one year deadline; and adjudicating student petitions for academic reinstatement to the University. Conferral of an accredited transferable Associate's or Bachelor's degree constitutes automatic reinstatement to the University once an official copy of a transcript with degree posted is presented to the Office of the Registrar. Petition forms to make retroactive changes to undergraduate academic record, or to seek reinstatement to the University may be obtained at www.pdx.edu/registration/petitions . Forms may also be obtained at the Registrar's Office, FMH Lobby. For further information call 503-725-3220.

Wooster Dean of the Graduate School 184 Parkmill (1633 SW Park Avenue) 503-725-8410 pdx.edu/gradschool Portland State University graduate programs offer a variety of opportunities for advanced study and research, including preparation for academic or professional careers, continuation and improvement of skills for in-service professionals, personal intellectual enrichment, and professional development. More than 5,000 graduate students are enrolled in the University's colleges and schools, and over 1,900 graduate degrees are awarded annually in the more than 80 master's and the 21 doctoral programs. The Graduate School oversees the University's graduate programs in the interest of ensuring quality instruction and research and promoting the highest achievement of graduate students. It is the principal resource concerning graduate admission policies and procedures, advanced degree requirements, degree status, petition procedures, thesis or dissertation preparation, and final oral examinations. All matters of graduate study are subject to the policies and procedures established by the Faculty Senate upon recommendation of the Graduate Council. The Graduate Council develops and recommends University policies and regulations for graduate studies, recommends standards for graduate courses and programs, and adjudicates petitions regarding graduate policies. Student responsibility The student is responsible for knowing all regulations and procedures required by the University and the graduate program being pursued. In no case will a regulation be waived or an exception granted because of ignorance of the regulation or of the assertion that the student was not informed by the adviser or other authority. The student should be familiar with information published in the Portland State University Bulletin , including the section on the Graduate School and the section listing the requirements for the degree and the offerings and requirements of the major department. The department chair appoints an adviser for each graduate student to assist in developing the course of study, determining deficiencies, planning the program, and clarifying special regulations. Departments can be expected to have additional degree requirements beyond those listed in the Bulletin . A graduate student may petition the Graduate Council for the waiver of a University graduate academic regulation or degree requirement. The petition process is an option in unusual cases with extenuating circumstances. A petition is not a remedy for poor advising on the part of an academic unit or poor planning by the student. The responsibility of initiating the petition rests with the student. Petition forms are available from the Graduate School. The decision of the Graduate Council is final. The University reserves the right to require the withdrawal of any student who fails to accept responsibilities, as evidenced by conduct or scholastic achievement. Admissions requirements Graduate admission requirements Graduate admission is selective and meeting minimum requirements does not guarantee admission. The number of students admitted to a particular program is limited to the resources and space available in each program. All applicants for a graduate degree or certificate program must meet minimum University admission requirements as well as departmental requirements. University admission requirements include: A bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution Minimum GPA. To be considered for Regular admission, applicants must have a minimum cumulative undergraduate GPA of 2.75 or the equivalent (on the U.S. 4.0 scale) from the degree granting institution(s). Applicants who have earned 9 or more letter-graded graduate credits must have a minimum graduate GPA of 3.0 or the equivalent; this graduate GPA supersedes the undergraduate GPA. Applicants who have a cumulative undergraduate GPA between 2.5 and 2.74 or the equivalent from the degree granting institution(s) are eligible for University Conditional status. After completing 9 letter-graded graduate credits at PSU with a GPA of 3.0 or higher, students with University Conditional status will automatically be given Regular status. Previous PSU students returning after an extended absence can be considered for Academic Forgiveness which will allow up to three terms to be excluded from the cumulative graduate GPA calculation Copies of transcripts from all colleges and/or universities attended (except PSU), including junior colleges and community colleges $65 application fee + $2 processing fee Recommendation for admission from the appropriate graduate program's department University enrollment requirements include: Verification of official transcripts from degree granting institution(s) and all colleges and/or universities attended where any graduate credits were completed Proof of English language proficiency as demonstrated by: Completion of a bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree in Australia, English-speaking Canada, Ghana, Ireland, Kenya, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, United Kingdom, United States, or Zimbabwe, or; Completion of Portland State's Intensive English Language Program (IELP) with a 3.50 GPA in all courses and recommendation from the IELP, or; Completion of one of the following exams: International Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), minimum overall score of 80; minimum subscores of 18 in reading and writing International English Testing Systems (IELTS) exam, minimum overall score of 6.5; minimum subscores of 6.5 in reading and writing Pearson Test of English-Academic (PTE), minimum score of 60 overall Duolingo English Test (DET), minimum score of 110 Tests more than two years old are accepted if the score exceeds the minimum requirement and the applicant has maintained continuous residency in the United States since the exam date In cases when a student does not meet University admission requirements, departments may choose to submit a Graduate Admission - Special Approval Request to the Graduate School. This process may only be initiated by a department. International applicants must also submit: Copies of official degree certificates/diplomas Certified translation of transcripts and degree certificates/diplomas Financial documentation demonstrating adequate financial support for at least the first year of study Depending on the individual graduate program, additional departmental requirements may include: Personal essay or statement of purpose Letters of recommendation Standardized test scores, e.g. GRE or GMAT Resume Writing samples Portfolio Information regarding departmental requirements can only be obtained directly from the specific department. Three-Year Bridge program This program is an alternate method of meeting graduate admission requirements. It is designed for international students coming from non-Bologna-compliant three-year baccalaureate degree programs recognized by the Ministries of Education in their home countries. This program comprises approximately one year of academic study intended to bridge the differences between the applicant's degree and a four-year U.S. baccalaureate degree. Students are invited to participate in this program only if they have been recommended for admission by their departments. 1. Students graduating from international educational institutions with thirteen years of pre-collegiate work, 'A-level' passes, and three-year bachelor's degrees are directly admissible to PSU graduate programs if they meet all other university requirements. 2. As a general principle, students with twelve years of pre-collegiate education and three-year bachelor's degrees are admissible to graduate programs at PSU only if they complete one additional year of acceptable coursework. a. When additional coursework is required for admission to graduate study, specific courses must be approved by the Graduate School, in consultation with appropriate program/college officials. b. Coursework is a year's duration and totals 30 - 42 credit hours, with 16 graduate credits that can be applied towards a graduate degree. 3. 'Special Action' exceptions of Graduate School Conditional Admission could waive the additional year of additional work describe in #2. Requests will be considered on the basis of acceptable evidence that the applicant is judged by appropriate campus authority to possess sufficient academic, professional and other potential pertinent to the applicant's educational objectives to merit such action. 'Special Action' exceptions require submission of additional information. Examples of additional information needed to support the request for Special Action admission are: a. Test score results (GRE general and/or specialty tests; GMAT; departmental placement examinations) b. Completion of one year of college-level work at a regionally accredited U.S. university in a field related to the field of application c. Department faculty evaluation of a portfolio of the student's work in the field (e.g., published articles, research, creative work, relevant awards, professional licensure) d. Department faculty evaluation of coursework taken at the international university (review of syllabi, reading lists, prerequisite preparation, recommendations) and of English communication skills e. Commitment of individual faculty members who will act as advisors to the student. 4. All special approval admissions requests under either #2 or #3 above must be initiated by the department and processed through the Graduate School's admissions system. Requests should include support for why special consideration should be considered. 5. When additional coursework is required for admission to graduate study, specific courses must be approved by the Graduate School, in consultation with appropriate program/college officials. Coursework is a year's duration and totals 30 - 42 credit hours, with 16 of these credits countable towards the graduate program. 6. Admission to Portland State University to complete graduate admission preparation (#2) or with a 'Special Action' exemption (#3) does not confer 'baccalaureate possession' rights or privileges acceptable either for the seeking of an American teaching credential or for transfer to graduate programs at other U.S. higher education institutions. Moreover, students so admitted will not be eligible to earn a baccalaureate degree at the University. Admission statuses All admitted graduate certificate and degree students will be assigned one of the following admission statuses: Regular status To be considered for Regular status, applicants must have a minimum cumulative undergraduate GPA of 2.75 or the equivalent (on the U.S. 4.0 scale) from the degree granting institution(s). Applicants who have earned 9 or more letter-graded graduate credits must have a minimum graduate GPA of 3.0 or the equivalent; this graduate GPA supersedes the undergraduate GPA. University Conditional status Applicants who have a cumulative undergraduate GPA between 2.5 and 2.74 or the equivalent from the degree-granting institution(s) are eligible for University Conditional status. Students admitted with University Conditional status must achieve a 3.0 cumulative graduate GPA, based on all graduate courses taken at PSU, once they have completed 9 letter-graded graduate credits after admission. Students who meet the University Conditional status GPA requirement will automatically be converted to Regular status. Students with University Conditional status who do not earn a cumulative graduate GPA of 3.0 or higher once completing 9 letter-graded graduate credits at PSU after admission will have their admission canceled. Department Conditional status Department Conditional status may be imposed on a student who has a deficiency in departmental requirements. These conditions may include GPA requirements or additional coursework and may be more rigorous than University Conditional status or other University standards. Department Conditional status is removed once a department determines the appropriate requirements have been met. Students who do not fulfill the requirements of their Department Conditional status can have their admission canceled by the department. Both University Conditional and Department Conditional status Students who have both University Conditional status and Department Conditional status are subject to all of the policies stated above. University Conditional status and Department Conditional status are removed independent of each other, and usually not at the same time. Postbaccalaureate Students not currently working toward a degree but who wish to register for more than 8 graduate credits per term may be admitted to postbaccalaureate status. A postbaccalaureate student may find departmental enrollment limitations on many courses. A postbaccalaureate student wishing to be admitted to a graduate certificate or degree program must apply in the same way as any other applicant, meet the general University requirements, and be recommended for admission by the department. Courses completed in a postbaccalaureate status are not automatically applied toward a graduate degree; each course must be evaluated and recommended by the department and is considered pre-admission credit to which all pre-admission limits and requirements apply. See Pre-admission and transfer credit for additional details. Enrollment Validation of admission Students must register for a minimum of 1 credit during their term of admission; failure to do so will result in cancellation of admission. Graduate grading system The following grading scale is employed at the graduate level: A = 4.00 B- = 2.67 D+ = 1.33 A- = 3.67 C+ = 2.33 D = 1.00 B+ = 3.33 C = 2.00 D- = 0.67 B = 3.00 C- = 1.67 F = 0.00 The grading system at the graduate level is defined as follows: A--Excellent B--Satisfactory C--Below graduate standard D--Failure F--Failure The following grades are also used; these marks do not impact the GPA: P--Pass (B- or better) NP--No Pass I--Incomplete IP--In progress W--Withdrawal X--Non-attendance/No basis for grade M--Missing grade/No grade received AU--Audit Academic Forgiveness Graduate Academic Forgiveness allows a PSU student, who returns after an extended absence, to begin a new graduate program with the benefit of excluding previously earned low grades from their PSU cumulative graduate GPA calculation. There must be, at minimum, a three-year break in registration at PSU between the terms considered for Graduate Academic Forgiveness and the student's term of admission to a new graduate program. If Graduate Academic Forgiveness is approved, courses from the applicable terms will remain on the student's transcript and will be include in attempted hours, but the courses will be excluded from the earned, passed, and GPA hours. A notation on the transcript will identify the courses as excluded from the graduate GPA calculation. A maximum of three terms can be approved for Graduate Academic Forgiveness. Once Graduate Academic Forgiveness is processed and the courses excluded from the graduate GPA calculation, the action is irreversible. Graduate Academic Forgiveness is applied to all graduate courses in the approved terms, not just those with low grades. Courses approved for Graduate Academic Forgiveness cannot be used toward any current or future graduate degree or certificate requirements at PSU. A student who has previously been placed on graduate academic probation or disqualification at PSU is not eligible for Graduate Academic Forgiveness for the same program. Graduate Academic Forgiveness cannot be requested after a student has earned a graduate degree or certificate at PSU. A student may receive Graduate Academic Forgiveness only once during their time as a graduate student at PSU, regardless of how many graduate programs they may have participated in. If Graduate Academic Forgiveness is approved as part of the graduate admission process, the student will be admitted with University Conditional status. After admission, the student must earn a 3.0 graduate GPA or higher in their first 9 letter-graded graduate credits after admission. If the student earns a 3.0 GPA or higher, and has already been approved for Graduate Academic Forgiveness, the approved terms will be excluded from their graduate GPA calculation. If the need for Graduate Academic Forgiveness is identified post admission, the student must earn a 3.0 graduate GPA or higher in their first 9 letter-graded graduate credits after admission to their new graduate program before being eligible to apply for Graduate Academic Forgiveness. Responsibility for dropping courses It is the student's responsibility to drop courses they do not wish to attend. Non-attendance does not cancel the tuition charges nor prevent the course from appearing on the student's academic record. Non-completion of course A student who has participated in a course but has failed to complete essential work or attend examinations, and who has not communicated with the instructor, will be assigned the appropriate grade based on coursework completed. Incompletes Students do not have a right to receive/demand an Incomplete grade. The option of assigning an Incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor when the following criteria are met. Eligibility Criteria Required satisfactory course completion/participation . The quality of work is satisfactory, but some essential work remains. In addition, the student must have successfully completed most of the course work at the time the student requests the Incomplete, with a minimum grade up to that point of a B- for a graduate course. Reasonable justification for the request . Reasons for assigning the Incomplete must be acceptable to the instructor. A student does not have the right to demand an Incomplete. The circumstances should be unforeseen or beyond the control of the student. The instructor is entitled to request appropriate medical or other documentation to validate the student's request. Incomplete grade is not a substitute for a poor grade . The Incomplete grade is not meant to create the opportunity for special or additional work for a student to raise a poor grade, or for the opportunity to take the course over by sitting in on the course in a later term without registering or paying for it. Written agreement . A written or electronic agreement will be endorsed by both the instructor and student. The document will specify a) the remaining work to be completed, b) the highest grade which may be awarded upon submission of remaining items, and c) the date which the missing work is due. The latter may not exceed one year from the end of the term of enrollment for the given course. A template Incomplete Contract is available from the Registrar. Resolving the Incomplete . Instructors may not encourage students to \"sit in\" an entire future course in order to resolve the Incomplete grade. If the student needs to retake the entire course, they should be given the grade presently earned, and must formally register for the future class they will be attending. If the missed portion of the course is no longer available, instructors may offer an alternate assignment. Grading weight of the alternate assignment should not exceed the original assignment. Students are fully responsible for monitoring all due dates. Other Rules: GPA Calculation . Incomplete grades are not included when calculating GPA. Deadline for Completion . The deadline for completion of an Incomplete is one calendar year. The instructor may set a shorter deadline, which is binding. Any request for a longer deadline must be requested via petition to the Graduate Council. Failure to make up an Incomplete by the end of one year . The Incomplete will become part of the student's permanent academic record for a graduate course. Drops and withdrawals Drops/withdrawals from a course must be initiated by the student. It is the student's responsibility to drop/withdraw properly by the published deadlines dates . A student may drop with no record on the transcript up to the end of the second week of the term. As a courtesy, students are advised to notify the instructor concerned of the intended or completed drop. A student may withdraw for any reason before the end of the seventh week. Withdrawing in the third through seventh week will result in a \"W\" recorded on the transcript. A student wishing to withdraw after the seventh week must petition the Deadline Appeals Committee . A \"W\" is recorded if the petition is approved. Refunds are automatic and are calculated from the date of official drop/withdrawal. The refund is 100% only if the drop occurs within the first week of the term. The above deadlines refer to fall, winter and spring terms. For deadlines during summer session, consult the Registrar's Academic Calendar . No Basis for Grade (X grades) An X grade indicates No Basis for Grade and is used when there is little or no attendance and there is no work/performance upon which to base an academic evaluation. X grades cannot be changed after initial submission, and other grades cannot be changed to an X. An auditor may also be assigned an X for insufficient attendance. Missing Grade (M grades) If an instructor does not award a grade during the open grading window, an M grade (Missing) is automatically assigned. An M grade will change to a grade of X one term after the M was initially assigned. Once converted to an X, the grade cannot be changed. A graduate student will not be certified for graduation who has any M grades in PSU graduate courses that could potentially be letter graded, even if the courses are not applied to the student's degree. Audit (AU) Graduate students may take any course for which they have the prerequisites and which is open to them on the basis of their admission category on an audit (no-credit) basis. The tuition and fees for auditing courses are the same as for taking the courses for credit, but a student's load (total credit hours) does not include audit enrollments. Audited courses cannot be used to meet any requirement for degrees or certificates, for required registration for graduate assistants, or for scholarship students. Students cannot receive financial aid for audited courses. During the add-drop period, a student registered for a course for audit may change to credit status or vice versa through the official methods; thereafter, the change cannot be made. Academic record sealed after degree awarded PSU academic records are sealed thirty days after the conferral of a degree. After this date, no changes can be made to the academic record, such as removal of Incompletes or grade changes, except via petition to the Graduate Council. Catalog eligibility To earn a graduate degree, students must meet the degree requirements published in a single, valid PSU Bulletin (catalog). The requirements in a catalog are valid for seven years; for example, the 2023-24 Bulletin can be used through summer 2030 graduation. Students can only use a catalog year during which they were both admitted and enrolled. At the time a graduate program has a change to their curriculum approved, they may set more restrictive limits about which set of requirements (catalog year) can be used. Credit distribution and limitations Courses applied to any graduate certificate or degree program must be at the 500 or 600 level. Courses at the 700 and 800 level are not acceptable in any graduate certificate or degree programs, with the exception of 800-level courses in the master's degree programs in the College of Education as well as some M.A.T./M.S.T. programs; these programs may allow a maximum of 6 credits at the 800 level. Student teaching credits cannot be applied to a graduate degree or certificate. Students who take 400/500 courses at the 500 level must complete distinct requirements from those in the 400-level section. With the exception of coursework taken as part of a bachelors+masters program or pre-admission credits taken while still an undergraduate, graduate tuition is charged for all graduate-level coursework. At the master's level, a minimum of 12 credits in a 45-credit program must be taken in residence in 500, 500/600, or 600 course level categories. The remainder of the required credits may be 400/500 courses taken at the 500 level. Limitations are placed on the number of 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 508, and 509 credits that can be applied to master's degrees. In a 45-credit program, the limits are as follows: a maximum of 12 credits in 501, 502, and 505 combined; a maximum of 9 credits in 504, 508, and 509 combined; a range of 6 to 9 credits in 503. Courses numbered 60x are included in these limitations. Repeat of graduate courses If a graduate course is repeated, the grades awarded both times are included in the GPA. Repeating courses with the sole intent of raising the GPA is not acceptable. A graduate course cannot be repeated and applied to degree requirements twice unless the course has been approved as repeatable for credit. If a course offered as a 400/500 level course is taken for credit at the 400 level, the same course cannot be taken again for credit at the 500 level. Correspondence credit Under no circumstance will credit earned through correspondence study be acceptable toward a graduate degree or certificate. Academic load Full-time enrollment for graduate students is 9-16 credits. Graduate students must obtain approval for registration in excess of 16 credits (graduate and undergraduate credits combined) via the Overload Approva l form. A student registering for 17 to 19 credits must obtain the approval from their department chair or faculty adviser. A student registering for 20 credits or more must obtain the approval of their department chair and the Graduate School. A graduate assistant registering for more than 16 credits must obtain approval from their department chair and the Graduate School. Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering graduate students have a lower maximum registration limit of 10 credits. These students must obtain approval to register for 11 or more credits via the Overload Approval form. Minimum enrollment PSU requires that graduate students who are involved in activities requiring faculty time or the use of University facilities register every term (excluding summer), including those engaged in any phase of research, such as collecting or developing data, or when engaged in any aspects of a project, thesis, or dissertation. After advancement to candidacy, doctoral students must be continuously enrolled for a minimum of 1 graduate credit every term (excluding summer) through the term of graduation. A minimum of 1 graduate credit of registration is required in any term (including summer) when students are completing a major milestone for the degree such as taking any comprehensive or final examination, when holding a thesis/dissertation proposal or defense, and in the term of final thesis/dissertation submission and graduation. The student's department can require additional registration in any given term in relation to the amount of time required of faculty or the use of University facilities. Enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms Defenses and exams should be held during regular academic terms, i.e., not between terms. However, if it is necessary to hold a thesis/dissertation proposal or final defense, a final project presentation, or comprehensive/preliminary exams in the period between terms, and all faculty involved in the defense or exam have agreed to participate at this time, graduate programs are allowed to schedule defenses and exams between terms provided the following registration requirements are met by the student. Per the Minimum Enrollment policy, required registration for a defense or exam is a minimum of 1 graduate credit applicable to the degree. * For defenses and exams held between the end of fall term and the beginning of winter term, the student must be registered in the immediately preceding fall term. * For defenses and exams held between the end of winter term and the beginning of spring term, the student must be registered in the immediately preceding winter term. * For defenses and exams held between the end of spring term and the beginning of summer term, the student must be registered in the immediately preceding spring term. * For defenses and exams held between the end of summer term and the beginning of fall term, the student must be registered in the immediately succeeding fall term. * The Graduate School identifies summer term as the 8-week summer session defined by the university's Academic Calendar . For defenses/exams held during summer term, the student must be registered in one of the summer term sessions. Students should be aware that most faculty are not on contract over the summer and may not be available for defenses and exams in summer. Residency requirements Residence credit is defined as credit taken at PSU after formal admission to a graduate degree program. Residency requirements are intended to ensure that students work in close association with other graduate scholars in the intellectual environment of PSU. In a master's program, to meet the residency requirement a student must earn a minimum of two-thirds of the credits required for the degree after formal admission to a master's degree program at PSU. In a doctoral program, the residency requirement can be satisfied in one of the following ways: Three terms of full-time enrollment (minimum 9 graduate credits applicable to the degree program each term) during the first two years after admission to the program. This may include one or more summer terms. Six terms of part-time enrollment (minimum 1 graduate credit applicable to the degree program each term) during the first two years after admission to the program. This may include one or more summer terms. A doctoral student who was enrolled in the same major at PSU, and whose matriculation to the doctoral program immediately follows (within one calendar year) the master's degree program, may fulfill the residency requirement during the period in which the student was enrolled in the master's program. Pre-admission and transfer credit Courses taken at any institution, including PSU, before the term of formal admission to a PSU graduate degree program are pre-admission credits. Courses taken at any other institution at any time are transfer credits. Transfer credits must be graduate credit taken at a regionally accredited institution and applicable to a graduate degree program without qualification at the originating institution. A master's student must earn a minimum of two-thirds of the credits required for the degree after formal admission to the graduate degree program at PSU and must earn a minimum of two-thirds of the credits required for the degree at PSU. Departments may have stricter limitations. Pre-admission credits taken at PSU and applied to master's degree requirements must be letter-graded B- or higher or graded Pass. Pre-admission or transfer credits taken at another institution and applied to master's degree requirements must be letter-graded B- or higher (Pass or similar grading methods are not acceptable). All pre-admission and transfer credits (whether taken at PSU or elsewhere) and applied to master's degree requirements must also meet all the following requirements: must not be used for any other degree at any institution (except for dual master's degrees ); must be no older than seven years old at the time the master's degree is awarded; and must total no more than one third of the required credits for a master' degree program. Otherwise eligible PSU credits applied toward a completed graduate certificate can be applied toward a subsequent master's degree without counting toward the pre-admission limits. For master's degrees, pre-admission credits taken at PSU are requested via a DARS exception submitted to the Graduate School. This request should be made soon after admission to the graduate program. Transfer courses from another regionally accredited institution are requested via the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21M) submitted to the Graduate School. It is strongly suggested that this form be submitted early in the student's program. (The M.S.W. program has specific transfer credit allowances resulting from accreditation requirements and inter-institutional agreements, but a minimum of 42 credits applied to the M.S.W. must be taken at PSU.) For graduate certificates, two-thirds of the required credits, or 15 credits minimum, whichever is larger, must be taken at PSU. Individual programs may set higher minimums. Transfer credits for graduate certificates must be letter-graded B- or higher (Pass or similar grading methods are not acceptable) and must be no older than seven years old at the time the graduate certificate is awarded. Transfer credits from other institutions must be approved by the graduate certificate program and the Graduate School using the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21M) . Students are encouraged to apply for and be admitted to graduate certificate programs as early as possible. For doctoral degrees, pre-admission and transfer limits are at the discretion of the individual doctoral programs; however, 603 Dissertation/606 Project credits, or their equivalent, cannot be transferred from another university. Transfer credits are requested via the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21D) submitted to the Graduate School. Approved graduate transfer courses from other institutions are not entered on PSU transcripts and are not considered in the computation of PSU cumulative graduate GPA. However, transfer courses are included in the approved program of study for all graduate certificate and degree programs and are used to calculate the program GPA, which must be 3.0 or higher in order to graduate. Pre-admission and transfer credits from international institutions are subject to the same requirements and limitations. Requests for international pre-admission and transfer credits require additional documentation to facilitate verification of eligibility. Joint campus courses Admitted graduate students at PSU may take graduate courses offered by the University of Oregon or Oregon Health and Science University through the Joint Campus registration process. Joint Campus (JC) registration allows PSU students to have a graduate course from UO or OHSU included in their current term enrollment and tuition assessment at PSU. For additional details, see the Graduate School website . JC courses will be listed on the student's PSU transcript, however, JC courses are considered transfer credits for which all transfer credit limitations apply. After the course is completed, students will need to submit a GO-21 form to the Graduate School to request that the JC transfer credits be applied to their program of study at PSU. Course overlap between degrees and certificates In specific circumstances, coursework only (not a project, thesis/dissertation, comprehensive exam, or other culminating activity) can be shared between programs. There are limits on the use of eligible graduate courses between graduate programs. A graduate course that has been used to meet the requirements for a bachelor's degree or any undergraduate program cannot be applied to any graduate program (degree or certificate) unless the courses are part of a bachelors+masters program approved by the University, and the student has been admitted to that program. Graduate courses can be applied to two master's degrees only under the dual master's degrees allowance. Graduate courses can be applied to a master's degree and a doctoral degree provided the master's degree is awarded prior to or concurrent with the doctoral degree. Graduate courses can be applied to a master's degree and a graduate certificate. Graduate courses can be applied to a master's degree and a post-bac certificate. Graduate courses can be applied to a doctoral degree and a graduate certificate. Graduate courses can be applied to two graduate certificates unless both graduate certificates are included in a stackable degree program. Graduate courses can be applied to more than one doctoral program (at the discretion of both doctoral programs), but the following items must be completed at PSU for each doctoral degree: comprehensive exams, residency, proposal, advancement to candidacy, and dissertation research. Departments can set more restrictive limits. Bachelors+masters programs Bachelors+masters degree programs allow students to complete a bachelor's and master's degree at an accelerated pace. Students with upper-division standing may apply to an approved bachelors+masters degree program. The minimum institutional undergraduate GPA for admission to a bachelors+masters program cannot be less than 3.30; beyond the GPA minimum, individual programs will set their own admissions criteria. Students admitted to an approved bachelors+masters program can share a maximum of 20 graduate credits between a bachelor's and master's degree. Programs may choose to allow fewer shared credits. Shared credits will be considered pre-admission credits when applied to the master's degree. After admission to a bachelors+masters degree program, students must maintain an institutional undergraduate GPA of 3.30 and earn a B or higher in graduate courses taken for shared credit. Students in a bachelors+masters program who are pursuing their first bachelor's degree will be assessed undergraduate tuition for the graduate credits earned while working toward the bachelor's degree. Upon completion of the bachelor's degree, students who meet those requirements will be guaranteed admission to the master's program with shared credits. Students who do not meet those requirements would need to apply for admission to the master's degree program without the benefits of bachelors+masters shared coursework. Dual master's degrees A student may work toward the completion of the requirements for two PSU master's degrees in complementary disciplines or toward a master's degree at PSU and a partner university when there is a formal agreement between the two institutions. Dual master's degrees allow for sharing of credits between the two degrees. The credits to be shared between both master's degrees cannot exceed one-third of the required credits for a degree. If the two degrees have different total credit requirements, the one-third limit is determined by the smaller total credit requirement. Only coursework can be shared between two master's degrees; comprehensive exam, internship, practicum, project, thesis, or other culminating activity cannot be shared. Students are limited to one use of one dual master's degree allowance at PSU. Dual degree credits must be approved by the student's departments and the Graduate School with a Dual Degree Form (GO-14) . Leave of absence An admitted graduate student in good academic standing may request a leave of absence. A leave of absence (LoA) is a hiatus of a student's studies during which they are not registered and are not engaged in any phase of research or aspects of an exam, project, thesis, or dissertation. A leave of absence provides a guarantee that the student will be allowed to return to their graduate program at the agreed-upon time and exempts the student from the continuous enrollment requirement (applicable only to advanced Ph.D. students). However, a leave of absence does not constitute a waiver of the time limit for completion of a graduate program nor the one-year limit for completion of a course. A leave of absence is granted for a specific time period, up to a maximum of three terms (excluding summer). Students may request more than one leave of absence but all leaves combined cannot exceed six terms. A student with an approved leave of absence cannot: register for any coursework; engage in any phase of research or aspects of an exam, project, thesis, or dissertation; or engage in any activities that require faculty time or use of University resources. It is the student's responsibility to drop or withdraw from all courses as well as notify other appropriate offices on campus of their leave status (e.g. Financial Aid). A Graduate Leave of Absence Request must be submitted to the Graduate School no later than the Friday of the second week of the term for which the leave of absence should take effect. A leave of absence will not be approved retroactively. Re-enrollment Admitted graduate students who fail to enroll for credits for three consecutive terms (excluding summer) must submit a Graduate Re-Enrollment Request to their department. If this request is supported by their department, the form is signed and forwarded to the Graduate School for processing. To ensure timely registration, the completed Graduate Re-Enrollment Request should be received by the Graduate School no later than three weeks prior to the start of the term the student wishes to re-enroll. Per Executive Order 13607, students who are re-enrolling after an interruption due to military service can re-enroll in the same program, with the same enrollment status and the same academic standing, which they had when the military service began if they wish. The period of military service and an additional period of up to three years (limited to five years total), may be excluded from standard University time limits. Students must notify the Graduate School that they are returning from military services (and present appropriate documentation) so that the possible impact on time limits can be identified. Cancellation of admission to graduate program If a student does not validate admission by registering and paying for at least 1 credit at PSU in the term of admission, that admission will be canceled unless the student contacts Graduate Admissions and requests that the admission be updated to another term within a one-year period. If the student does not validate admission within a one-year period, the admission will be canceled and the student must submit a new application and a new application fee. A student with validated admission to a graduate certificate or degree program who during a one-year period (1) does not have an approved leave of absence and (2) does not successfully complete a graduate course in the approved program of study for the degree OR does not make satisfactory progress toward the degree (as determined by the department) may have admission to the degree program canceled. Additionally, a doctoral student who has not been registered for three years will have admission to the degree program canceled. For further information, students are urged to contact individual departments for departmental policies and practices. Faculty as student policy PSU faculty members are encouraged to pursue additional advanced degrees at other institutions. Faculty members above the rank of instructor are not eligible to receive an advanced degree in their own department or school at the University; however, in special circumstances, they may earn a degree in a department or school in which they do not hold an appointment. Academic Standing All admitted graduate certificate and degree students at PSU must maintain good academic standing during the course of their graduate program. Good academic standing is defined as maintaining a cumulative graduate GPA of 3.00 or higher in all graduate credits earned at PSU. All graduate students, especially those in a conditional admission status, are expected to keep in close communication with their departments and to avail themselves of departmental advising. Academic probation An admitted graduate student is placed on probation if their cumulative graduate GPA at PSU, based on the completion of 9 or more letter-graded graduate credits after admission to the graduate level at PSU, falls below 3.00. While on academic probation a student will not be permitted to graduate, to be admitted to a new or different graduate certificate or degree program, to be advanced to doctoral candidacy, to have a thesis or dissertation committee appointed, to receive or continue to hold a graduate assistantship, or to register for more than a total of 9 credit hours in any term. A student is removed from academic probation if their cumulative graduate GPA is brought up to 3.00 or higher once they have completed the next 9 letter-graded graduate credits after beginning probation status. Academic disqualification Disqualification occurs if: A student on academic probation fails to achieve a cumulative graduate GPA of 3.00 or higher once they have completed the next 9 letter-graded graduate credits after beginning probation status; or A student becomes subject to academic probation for a second time. A student who is disqualified may not register for any graduate courses at PSU. Readmission after disqualification Readmission after disqualification is not automatic. A disqualified student may petition for readmission as a student in a graduate certificate or degree program after one calendar year. Readmission after the mandatory one-year period is initiated by the student's filing of a petition for readmission to the Graduate Council through the Graduate School. Such a petition would need to address the circumstances that led to disqualification and provide evidence of preparedness to resume graduate study. If a student's graduate program recommends readmission, the Graduate Council may grant readmission, with or without additional academic requirements, or may recommend continued disqualification. A readmitted student must raise the cumulative graduate GPA to 3.00 or higher within the first 12 letter-graded credits after readmission or the student will be disqualified. Graduate courses completed at other institutions while a student is under disqualification at PSU will not be applied toward a graduate program at PSU. Academic honesty Graduate students have a primary, unique relationship and responsibility to the faculty of the academic departments, the faculty upon whose recommendations graduate degrees are awarded. A major feature of the graduate student's responsibilities to the faculty is the adherence to academic honesty. Academic honesty is a requirement for all graduate activities and assumes that the student is honest, that all coursework and examinations represent the student's own work, and that all documents supporting the student's admission and graduation are accurate and complete. Any violation of academic honesty may be subject to disciplinary sanction as provided in the PSU Student Conduct Code. Violations of academic honesty include but are not limited to: Cheating in examinations and course assignments. The willful use or provision to others of unauthorized materials in written or oral examinations or in course assignments. Plagiarism. The appropriation of language, ideas, and products of another author or artist and representation of them as one's own original work; failure to provide proper identification of source data; use of purchased or borrowed papers in graduate courses without complete identification of the source. Selling or offering to sell course assignment materials. Selling or offering to sell material to another person; knowing, or under circumstances having reason to know, that the whole or a substantial part of the material is intended to be submitted in fulfillment of a course requirement. Academic fraud . Furnishing false or incomplete information to the University with the intent to deceive; forging, altering, or misusing University documents or academic forms which serve as the basis for admission, course study, or graduation; misrepresenting a person's identity to an instructor or other University official. Tuition, fees, and aid Basic graduate fees Tuition and fees associated with graduate study at PSU are available from Student Financial Services . The admission application fee is required and is nonrefundable. All newly admitted graduate students are assessed a one-time graduate matriculation fee in their initial term of admission. Graduate tuition and fees assessed each term depend on the total number of credits in enrolled classes, differential tuition, and resident or nonresident status in the state of Oregon. Financial assistance Graduate assistantships The University offers graduate assistantships for teaching, research, and administrative support on a competitive basis for students working toward graduate degrees at PSU. To qualify and to remain eligible for an appointment, a student must be admitted to a graduate degree program, remain in good academic standing, and make satisfactory academic progress towards their degree. Students wishing to apply for graduate assistantships must correspond directly with the appropriate department offering the assistantship. Scholarships The Graduate School administers scholarships and awards through our office, and also provides links to external funding source. WICHE Under the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) Regional Graduate Program agreement, residents of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Federal States of Micronesia (FSM), Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), The Republic of Palau (PW), South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming admitted to specific degree programs are assessed resident tuition. A full list of approved programs is available on the application form . Completed applications are submitted to the Graduate School. Graduate programs The graduate programs offered by Portland State University are listed below. Graduate Certificates A graduate certificate program is a linked series of approved graduate-level courses which constitute a coherent body of study with a specific defined focus within a discipline. Candidates for a graduate certificate must earn a minimum of 15 credits in approved graduate courses; many programs have higher minimums. A final project or portfolio may be required to provide for integration of the sequence of course materials. Master of Arts and Master of Science (M.A. and M.S.) The University offers programs leading to the Master of Arts and the Master of Science. These programs are designed to develop a mastery of subject matter in a chosen discipline and to provide training and experience in research. Candidates for the Master of Arts and Master of Science degrees must earn a minimum of 45 credits in approved graduate courses; many programs have higher minimums. A thesis may be required, depending on the program. The Master of Arts degree requires a demonstrated proficiency in a second language. Second language proficiency is not required for the Master of Science degree. Master of Arts in Teaching and Master of Science in Teaching (M.A.T. and M.S.T.) The Master of Arts in Teaching and Master of Science in Teaching degrees are designed to combine coursework in the major discipline with coursework in education. To this end, the programs are developed and administered within flexible guidelines to match the needs of students with varying backgrounds and professional plans. All M.A.T. degrees require a demonstrated proficiency in a second language. Second language proficiency is not required for the M.S.T. degree. A minimum of 45 graduate credits is required. The program of study includes the following: At least 24 graduate credits must be devoted to selected courses in academic fields which strengthen the candidate's scholarship in a teaching field and related area. This minimum may be higher at the department's discretion. At least 9 credits of courses in education are required. A final written and oral examination is required. Professional Master's Degrees PSU offers a variety of master's degrees which are designed to prepare students for work in professional fields. The programs are designed to develop a mastery of the subject matter in a chosen discipline and to provide practical training and experience in the field. Many professional master's degrees require more than the minimum 45 credits required for all master's degrees at PSU. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for scholastic achievement based upon the candidate's proven comprehensive knowledge in a specialized field of study and for creative scholarship through independent research. Judgment of such attainments is based upon the passing of comprehensive examinations and evaluation of a dissertation grounded in independent research. Professional Doctoral Degrees A professional doctoral degree is awarded for advanced knowledge and skills designed to address real-world problems. Students demonstrate readiness for completing a culminating project by passing comprehensive examinations. Students then address a problem of practice by completing a culminating project supervised by a combination of faculty and industry leaders. Degree and certificate requirements Graduate certificates There are limits on the use of courses in graduate certificate programs that have not been fully approved through the curricular review process (i.e., courses numbered 501/601 through 510/610). A few graduate certificates require an omnibus course (e.g., 506 Project) as a culminating activity for the program. Apart from these required credits, courses numbered 501/601 through 509/609 are typically not allowed in graduate certificate programs. Experimental courses (i.e., courses numbered 510/610) can substitute for electives at the program's discretion, but all core courses must be fully approved. All graduate certificates are approved with a minimum number of required credits. These minimum credit totals cannot be waived even if the approved program of study exceeds the University minimum of 15 credits for a graduate certificate. Graduate certificate students must have a minimum 3.00 GPA on all courses applied to the program of study, as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in all graduate-level courses taken at PSU, in order to graduate. Departments may establish a more rigorous standard. Although grades of C+, C, and C- are below the graduate standard, they may be counted as credit toward a graduate certificate with the specific written approval of the program. Grades of D or F indicate clearly unacceptable work and cannot be applied to graduate certificate requirements. Audited courses cannot be used to meet any requirement for graduate certificates. Courses completed up to seven years prior to the certificate award date may be used to satisfy graduate certificate requirements (e.g., a course started in the fall term of 2016 will be beyond the seven-year limitation at the close of fall term 2023). For graduate certificates, transfer credit is defined as any eligible letter-graded (B- or higher) graduate course taken at another regionally accredited institution. Two-thirds of the credits required for a graduate certificate, or 15 credits minimum, whichever is larger, must be taken at PSU. Individual programs may set higher minimums. See the section on Course overlap between degrees and certificates for use of coursework in certificate programs. Students must apply for graduation by the first Friday of the anticipated term of graduation; see the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific due dates. There is a required $30 fee per application as well as a $2 service charge. As a one-time courtesy, students who do not complete certificate requirements can have their application for graduation carried forward to a future term (typically the next term, but it could be at maximum up to one year in advance). To request that an application for graduation be carried, students must contact the Graduate School in writing and provide an explanation for the graduation delay. If students do not graduate a second time, the application for graduation will be dropped; they will then need to reapply for graduation by the appropriate deadline (and will be assessed a new application fee). Master's degrees Second language requirement The second language requirement for M.A. and M.A.T. students must be met before any final exam is taken or final graduation paperwork can be approved. The Department of World Languages and Literatures has determined that the second language requirement for M.A. and M.A.T. students can be met in the following ways: Equivalent coursework: Students who have passed a course equivalent to PSU level 203 or higher in a second language will be deemed to have met the language requirement. The Graduate School will certify completion upon evaluation of the student's academic record if the requirement was completed at PSU. If the requirement was completed at a different institution, the Department of World Languages and Literatures will issue a certificate of completion. M.A. and M.A.T. students are responsible for making their academic records available in the first term of admission and requesting evaluation and certification. Students who do not meet the requirement under 1. above should make an appointment with the Department of World Languages and Literatures during the first term after their admission to make an individualized plan for the completion of their language requirement. Options include preparing for and passing one of these evaluations: Oral proficiency interview A written test such as The Graduate Student Foreign Language Test The CLEP exam A special exam, administered by the Department of World Languages and Literatures Coursework after admission: taking a course at level 203 or above in residence or abroad Special reading courses, if available. The Department of World Languages and Literatures will teach and test only in languages in which it has expertise. However, off-campus arrangements may be possible with the cooperation of other institutions and the approval of the chair of the Department of World Languages and Literatures. Certification of having passed a second language examination from an institution other than PSU must be approved by the Department Chair of World Languages and Literatures. A student whose native language is not English may meet the second language requirement in English, except for students in the M.A. in World Languages and Literatures, who are required to demonstrate fluency in two foreign languages other than English at the time of admission and are not required to demonstrate additional competency except as necessary to complete their degree requirements. Coursework and program of study In the first year a student should prepare a proposed program of study in consultation with an adviser. The purpose of the planned program of study is to present an organized, individualized plan for coursework, practica, and research activities consistent with the requirements for the proposed degree and approved by the adviser. If PSU pre-admission credits are to be included on the program of study, the department must submit a DARS exception to the Graduate School. If transfer credits (courses taken at any time from another regionally accredited institution) are to be included on the program of study, the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21M) must be submitted to the Graduate School for approval. See Pre-admission and transfer credit for detailed information. All master's degrees are approved with a minimum number of required credits. These minimum credit totals cannot be waived even if the approved program of study exceeds the University minimum of 45 credits for a master's degree. A student must have a minimum 3.00 GPA on the courses applied to the program of study, as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in all graduate-level courses taken at PSU, in order to graduate. Departments may establish a more rigorous standard. Although grades of C+, C, and C- are below the graduate standard, they may be counted as credit toward a master's degree with the specific written approval of the department if taken at PSU after the term of formal admission to the graduate program. Grades of D or F indicate clearly unacceptable work and cannot be applied to graduate degree requirements. Audited courses cannot be used to meet any requirement for master's degrees. A grade of IP (In Progress) may be used for 501 Research and for 506 Project when a student is progressing in an acceptable manner toward completion of the work; final grades for 501 and 506 credits are submitted by the instructor via an online grade change. An IP grade must be used for 503 Thesis when a student is progressing in an acceptable manner; final grades for 503 credits are assigned by the instructor on the Recommendation for the Degree form (GO-17M) and posted to the student's transcript after approval of the thesis and certification for graduation by the Graduate School. All coursework applied to the master's degree program must be completed within the seven years prior to the awarding of the degree (e.g., a course started in the fall term of 2016 will be beyond the seven-year limitation at the close of fall term 2023). Degree application Students must apply for graduation by the first Friday of the anticipated term of graduation; see the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific due dates. There is a required $30 fee per application as well as a $2 service charge. As a one-time courtesy, students who do not complete degree requirements can have their application for graduation carried forward to a future term (typically the next term, but it could be at maximum up to one year in advance). To request that an application for graduation be carried, students must contact the Graduate School in writing and provide an explanation for the graduation delay. If students do not graduate a second time, the application for graduation will be dropped; they will then need to reapply for graduation by the appropriate deadline (and will be assessed a new application fee). Human Research Protection Program All research involving human subjects conducted by faculty, staff, or students in any program at PSU must have Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) approval. This policy applies to all research under the auspices of the University, including surveys and questionnaires, whether supported by grant, contract, gift, University, or personal funds. The student should allow a minimum of six weeks for the approval process. A student cannot have a thesis committee appointed until HRPP approval is granted. Final examination If a final examination is required by the student's department, it must be taken after successful completion of any required second language examination and after at least 30 credits have been completed. The examination is not a re-examination over coursework but rather a test of the candidate's ability to integrate material in the major and related fields, including the work in any thesis or research project. A minimum of 1 graduate credit of registration is required when taking any final oral or written examination. Oral examinations In the case of a non-thesis oral examination, the committee must consist of at least two members of the student's department, including the student's adviser. At the discretion of the department, a faculty member from another department may be added. For M.A.T. and M.S.T. students, one additional member of the committee is required to be a faculty member from the College of Education or a faculty member with pedagogical expertise in the student's discipline. A non-thesis final oral examination (including a final project presentation) should be held during a regular academic term. If necessary, a final examination can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . Examinations must be scheduled and completed by the Friday of finals week for graduation in that term. For summer term graduation, the deadline applies to the regular eight-week summer session dates, i.e., exams must be scheduled and completed by the Friday of the eighth week of summer term. Passing of the final oral examination requires a majority approval. If the student fails the entire examination or any section thereof, the department may dismiss the student from the master's program or permit the student to repeat the entire examination, or the section that was failed, after a minimum of three months. The results of the second examination are final. Written examinations If a final written examination is required, it should be held during a regular academic term. If necessary, a final examination can be scheduled between terms, see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . Examinations must be scheduled and completed by the Friday of finals week for graduation in that term. For summer term graduation, the deadline applies to the regular eight-week summer session dates, i.e., exams must be scheduled and completed by the Friday of the eighth week of summer term. If the student fails the entire examination or any section thereof, the department may dismiss the student from the master's degree program or permit the student to repeat the entire examination, or the section that was failed, after a minimum of three months. The results of the second examination are final. Thesis The presentation of a thesis as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the master's degree is required in certain departments and is an option in others. Each school, college, and department defines the nature of research and scholarship accepted for a thesis, but in all cases a high level of resourcefulness, productivity, and mature perception of the discipline is expected. The quality of the culminating work must meet University standards and reflect those of other leading universities. Although the thesis is not required to show original results, it must reveal independent investigation, including the knowledge and application of the accepted methods of scholarship and research methodology. The thesis represents the independent work of the student and must be developed under the direction of the thesis adviser. The thesis committee must be approved by the Graduate School using the Appointment of Master's Thesis or Doctoral Dissertation Committee form (GO-16) in advance of the thesis defense. Master's thesis committees must consist of at least three and not more than five faculty members. The chair of the thesis committee must be regular, full-time PSU instructional faculty, tenured or tenure track, assistant professor or higher in rank; the other two to four committee members may be non-tenure track or adjunct faculty. Two of the committee members (the committee chair and one other member) must be from the student's department; the third member may be from the student's department or may be PSU faculty from another department or OHSU faculty. If it is necessary to go off campus for one additional committee member with specific expertise not available among PSU faculty, a CV for that proposed member must be submitted with the GO-16 form; this member must be in addition to the required three PSU faculty members. All committee members must have master's degrees or higher. No thesis defense shall be valid without a thesis committee approved by the Graduate School. The GO-16 form must be submitted to the Graduate School by the appropriate deadline for the intended term of graduation; see Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific dates. Students must be registered for at least 1 graduate credit in every term in which they are working on any phase of their thesis, including data development or collection, writing, revision, defense, and finalization through approval by the Graduate School. Students must register for at least 6 to 9 credits of 503 Thesis in their department. (Since students must be continuously enrolled while working on the thesis, they may accumulate more than 9 credits of 503 Thesis. However, a maximum of 9 credit of 503 Thesis may be applied to the program of study.) IP (In Progress) is the interim grade reported until the thesis is defended and approved by the student's thesis committee. Final grades for 503 Thesis credits are assigned by the instructor on the Recommendation for the Degree form (GO-17M) and posted to the student's transcript after approval of the thesis and certification for graduation by the Graduate School. A thesis defense should be scheduled during a regular academic term, no later than five weeks prior to the close of the term of application for graduation in which the degree will be granted (i.e., must be completed four weeks before the beginning of finals week). For summer term graduation, deadlines apply to the regular eight-week summer session dates. Later completion will result in graduation in a subsequent term. If necessary, a thesis defense can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . The student must deliver a final draft of the thesis to all members of the approved committee no fewer than 14 days before the thesis defense. See Oral Defenses of Theses and Dissertations for additional information on defense policies and procedures. A thesis defense must take place in a meeting with the student and the entire, appointed committee. While it is expected that all members should be physically present, remote participation is permitted under specific conditions . The student's oral presentation should not exceed 60 minutes. The thesis defense is open to the University faculty and may be open to the public at the department's discretion. Passing of the thesis defense requires a majority approval. If the student fails the thesis defense, the department may dismiss the student from the master's program or permit the student to hold a second defense after a minimum of three months. The results of the second defense are final. After passing the thesis defense, the student will be required to make any necessary edits and revisions. The final, post-defense version of the thesis must be approved by committee members by signing the Thesis Signature Page. For final approval, a majority of committee members must sign the Thesis Signature Page . The final thesis must be submitted to the Graduate School not later than three weeks prior to the close of the term of application for graduation. See the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific dates. For details about thesis formatting and submission, see the Thesis and Dissertation Information available from the Graduate School. Doctoral degrees Preliminary examinations Early in the doctoral program the student may be required to take preliminary examinations. The scope and content of the examination, and the standard of performance, is determined by the doctoral program. Preliminary exams should be held during regular academic terms. If necessary, preliminary exams can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . Advisory committee When a student enters the doctoral program, a faculty adviser will be designated by the program to advise the student and to meet in regular consultation concerning the program of study and research. It is recommended that students also have an advisory committee appointed that should consist of at least three faculty members representative of the student's field of study. The members of the advisory committee should be appointed after successful completion of 9 credits and not later than six months prior to the completion of the comprehensive examinations. Language requirement For the Ph.D. degree, the student may be required to demonstrate competency in at least one second language. Any second language requirement must be completed before the comprehensive examinations. Professional doctoral programs do not have a second language requirement. Residency requirement Residency for a doctoral degree program can be satisfied in one of the following ways: Three terms of full-time enrollment (minimum 9 graduate credits applicable to the degree program each term) during the first two years after admission to the program. This may include one or more summer terms. Six terms of part-time enrollment (minimum 1 graduate credit applicable to the degree program each term) during the first two years after admission to the program. This may include one or more summer terms. A doctoral student who was enrolled in the same major at PSU, and whose matriculation to the doctoral program immediately follows (within one calendar year) the master's degree program, may fulfill the residency requirement during the period in which the student was enrolled in the master's program. Coursework and doctoral program of study The doctoral program of study includes coursework, research, internships, and/or seminar credits according to the requirements of the individual doctoral program. A minimum of three academic years of graduate study beyond the bachelor's degree (equivalent to 81 quarter credits minimum) is required for all doctoral degrees. A minimum 27 credits of 603 Dissertation is required for all Ph.D. students; a minimum of 18 credits of 606 Project is required for all professional doctoral students. All doctoral degrees are approved with a minimum number of required credits. These minimum credit totals cannot be waived even if the approved program of study exceeds the University minimum of 81 credits for a doctoral degree. For doctoral degrees, pre-admission and transfer limits are at the discretion of the individual doctoral programs; however, 603 Dissertation/606 Project credits, or their equivalent, cannot be transferred from another university. Transfer credits are approved via a Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21D) submitted to the Graduate School. See Pre-admission and transfer credit for detailed information. While potentially all coursework for the degree can be transferred from another institution, the following items must be completed at PSU: comprehensive exams, residency, proposal, advancement to candidacy, and dissertation/project research. A student must have a minimum 3.00 GPA on the courses applied to the program of study, as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in all graduate-level courses taken at PSU, in order to graduate. Doctoral programs may establish a more rigorous standard. Although grades of C+, C, and C- are below the graduate standard, they may be counted as credit toward a doctoral degree with the specific written approval of the doctoral program. Grades of D or F indicate clearly unacceptable work and cannot be applied to graduate degree requirements. Audited courses cannot be used to meet any requirement for doctoral degrees. A grade of IP (In Progress) may be used for 601 Research and for 606 Project when a student is progressing in an acceptable manner toward completion of the work; final grades for 601 and 606 credits are assigned by the instructor via an online grade change. An IP grade must be used for 603 Dissertation when a student is progressing in an acceptable manner; final grades for 603 Dissertation credits are assigned by the instructor on the Recommendation for the Degree form (GO-17D) and posted to the student's transcript after approval of the dissertation and certification for graduation by the Graduate School. All coursework on the program of study, with the possible exception of seminar and internships, must be completed before a Ph.D. student can be advanced to doctoral candidacy. All coursework on the program of study must be satisfactorily completed before graduation. For students entering a Ph.D. program with a master's degree, a maximum of five years will be allowed from admission to completion of all required comprehensive examinations. For students entering a Ph.D. program with a bachelor's degree, a maximum of two additional years will be added to this limit, for a maximum of seven years from admission to completion of all comprehensive examinations. For students entering a professional doctoral program, a maximum of four years will be allowed from admission to completion of all required comprehensive examinations. Failure to meet these time limits will result in cancellation of admission to the doctoral program. Comprehensive examination Before advancement to candidacy and not less than one academic year before all requirements for the doctoral degree are expected to be completed, the student must pass a series of comprehensive examinations in the field of specialization. The examinations may be written, oral, or both. The comprehensive examinations may not be taken until the language requirement, if any, and substantially all the coursework for the degree have been completed. Students must be registered for a minimum of 1 graduate credit during the term comprehensive exams are taken. Comprehensive exams are scheduled and administered in accordance with the established rules of the program, which must be made publicly available to students via the program's website or doctoral student handbook. Comprehensive exams should be held during regular academic terms. If necessary, comprehensive exams can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . The doctoral program must notify the Graduate School the student has passed comprehensive exams by submitting the Report on Passing Comprehensive Examinations form (GO-22) . If the student fails the entire comprehensive exam or any section thereof, the doctoral program may dismiss the student from the degree program or permit the student to repeat the entire examination, or the section that was failed, after a minimum of three months. The results of the second examination are final. For Ph.D. students, a maximum of three years will be allowed from the completion of comprehensive examinations to advancement to candidacy. For professional doctoral students, a maximum of five years will be allowed from the completion of comprehensive examinations to graduation. Failure to meet these time limits will result in cancellation of admission to the doctoral program. Culminating Project Professional doctoral students will complete a culminating project in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. After passing the comprehensive examination and identifying a culminating project topic, a project committee is appointed. The project committee will take the place of the advisory committee and the faculty adviser is superseded by the project adviser. The culminating project committee must consist of three to five members. The chair must be a PSU tenure track or non-tenure track faculty member. Potentially all of the regular committee members can be off-campus members. At least two committee members (the chair and a regular member) must have doctoral degrees. At the discretion of the program, the designation of co-chair can be used for one regular member of the committee. The designation of co-chair recognizes the significant academic advising role of the committee member, but oversight of the process and procedures and all administrative responsibilities remains with the chair. A proposal is not required for a culminating project, but some programs may develop their own internal proposal process. Professional doctoral students are not advanced to candidacy, but they are required to obtain Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) approval if appropriate (see below). With guidance from the culminating project committee, the student prepares a project designed to address a problem of practice. Until the degree is granted, the student enrolls for the number of graduate credits appropriate to the amount of University services utilized, as determined by the project chair, with a minimum of 1 graduate credit each term. Professional doctoral students must register for 18 credits of 606 Project before graduation. For professional doctoral students, a maximum of five years will be allowed from the completion of comprehensive examinations to graduation. Individual programs may have stricter limits. Failure to meet this time limit will result in cancellation of admission to the doctoral program. Dissertation proposal Ph.D. students will complete a dissertation in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. After passing the comprehensive examination and identifying a dissertation topic, a dissertation committee is appointed and the student must pass a proposal defense (some programs refer to the proposal defense as a prospectus or colloquium). The dissertation committee will take the place of the advisory committee and the faculty adviser is superseded by the dissertation chair. The dissertation committee must be approved by the Graduate School using the Appointment of Master's Thesis or Doctoral Dissertation Committee form (GO-16) . Ph.D. dissertation committees must consist of at least four and not more than six faculty members. The chair of the dissertation committee must be regular, full-time PSU instructional faculty, tenured or tenure track, assistant professor or higher in rank; the other three to five committee members may include non-tenure track or adjunct faculty and/or members of the OHSU faculty. If it is necessary to go off campus for a committee member with specific expertise not available among PSU faculty, a CV for that proposed member must be submitted with the GO-16 form; this off-campus member may substitute for one of the three to five regular committee members. All committee members must have doctoral degrees. At the discretion of the program, the designation of co-chair can be requested on the GO-16 form for one regular member of the committee. The designation of co-chair recognizes the significant academic advising role of the committee member, but oversight of the process and procedures and all administrative responsibilities remains with the chair. No proposal defense shall be valid without a dissertation committee approved by the Graduate School. The GO-16 form should be submitted to the Graduate School a minimum of six weeks in advance of the estimated date of the dissertation proposal meeting. The student must deliver a draft of the dissertation proposal to all members of the approved committee no fewer than 14 days before the proposal defense. A dissertation proposal should be scheduled during a regular academic term. If necessary, a dissertation proposal can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . A dissertation proposal must take place in a meeting with the student and the entire, appointed committee. While it is expected that all members should be physically present, remote participation is permitted under specific conditions . The student will make an oral presentation of the written proposal for discussion, evaluation, and suggested modification. The final proposal submitted to the committee for approval should be sufficiently detailed and clear to provide a blueprint for the study to follow. The proposal is expected to include the following: General nature and present status of knowledge of the problem. The theoretical and empirical framework within which the proposed problem exists. The significance of the proposed research and its likely contributions. The research methodology to be used. The Ph.D. program recommends the student for advancement to candidacy once the dissertation proposal has been approved. Human Research Protection Program All research involving human subjects conducted by faculty, staff or students in any program at PSU must have Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) approval. This policy applies to all research under the auspices of the University, including surveys and questionnaires, whether supported by grant, contract, gift, University, or personal funds. After proposal approval, the student must submit a HRPP application to the Office of Research Integrity if human subjects are involved in the research in any way. A student cannot be advanced to candidacy until HRPP approval is granted. The student should allow a minimum of six weeks for the approval process. Advancement to Candidacy A student is advanced to candidacy after successful defense of the dissertation proposal and with the recommendation of the Ph.D. program, after verification of the student's program of study, and after HRPP approval has been granted (if applicable). The Ph.D. program must request advancement by submitting the Request for Advancement to Candidacy form (GO-23) to the Graduate School. The Dean of the Graduate School retains final approval authority for advancement to candidacy. A doctoral candidate has a minimum of four months and a maximum of five years from the effective date of advancement to candidacy to complete all requirements for graduation, including defense of the dissertation and its final approval by the Graduate School (doctoral programs may have stricter requirements). Candidates must be continuously enrolled during that period. Failure to meet this time limit will result in cancellation of admission to the doctoral program. Dissertation preparation With guidance of the dissertation committee, the candidate presents a dissertation setting forth the results of original and independent investigation. The dissertation must constitute a contribution to knowledge, significantly enlarging, modifying, or reinterpreting what was previously known. Until the degree is granted, the student enrolls for the number of graduate credits appropriate to the amount of University services utilized, as determined by the dissertation adviser, with a minimum of 1 graduate credit each term. Ph.D. students must register for a minimum of 27 credits of 603 Dissertation before graduation. Continuous enrollment of a minimum 1 graduate credit is required through the term a student graduates, even if this results in more than 27 credits of 603 Dissertation at the time of graduation. Ph.D. students should only register for 603 Dissertation credits after advancement to candidacy. Degree application All doctoral students must apply for graduation by the first Friday of the anticipated term of graduation; see the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific due dates. There is a required $30 fee per application as well as a $2 service charge. As a one-time courtesy, students who do not complete degree requirements can have their application for graduation carried forward to a future term (typically the next term, but it could be at maximum up to one year in advance). To request that an application for graduation be carried, students must contact the Graduate School in writing and provide an explanation for the graduation delay. If students do not graduate a second time, the application for graduation will be dropped; they will then need to reapply for graduation by the appropriate deadline (and will be assessed a new fee). Dissertation defense After preparation of the written dissertation, the candidate's dissertation committee will conduct a dissertation defense. A dissertation defense should be scheduled during a regular academic term, no later than five weeks prior to the close of the term of application for graduation in which the degree will be granted (i.e., must be completed four weeks before the beginning of finals week). For summer term graduation, deadlines apply to the regular eight-week summer session dates. Later completion will result in graduation in a subsequent term. If necessary, a dissertation defense can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . The student must deliver a final draft of the dissertation to all members of the approved committee no fewer than 14 days before the dissertation defense. See Oral Defenses of Theses and Dissertations for additional information on defense policies and procedures. The dissertation defense, which is open to the public, is the culminating experience in the student's Ph.D. studies. The candidate is expected to prepare an oral presentation on the research methodology and results. The oral presentation should not exceed 60 minutes. Following the oral presentation, the candidate must defend the dissertation as a worthy contribution to knowledge in its field and must demonstrate a mastery of the field of specialization as it is related to the dissertation. The questioning and discussion are for the purpose of further enlightenment of the candidate and the committee on the significance and limitations of the research and demonstration that the candidate has met the high expectations of the University for the awarding of the doctoral degree. A dissertation defense must take place in a meeting with the student and the entire, appointed committee. If there is a need to update dissertation committee membership from what was originally approved on the GO-16 form, the update must be approved by the Graduate School before the final defense. While it is expected that all members should be physically present, remote participation is permitted under specific conditions . For dissertation approval, there may be no more than one dissenting vote on the dissertation defense. If the student fails the dissertation defense, the doctoral program may dismiss the student from the program or permit the student to hold a second defense after a minimum of three months. The results of the second defense are final. After passing the dissertation defense, the student will be required to make any necessary edits and revisions. The final, post-defense version of the dissertation must be approved by committee members by signing the Dissertation Signature Page . For final approval, there may be no more than one committee member who does not approve the final, post-defense version of the dissertation by not signing the Dissertation Signature Page. The final dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School not later than three weeks prior to the close of the term of application for graduation. See the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific dates. For details about thesis formatting and submission, see the Thesis and Dissertation Information available from the Graduate School. Time limitations Time limitations for Ph.D. students: For students entering a Ph.D. program with a master's degree, a maximum of five years will be allowed from admission to completion of all required comprehensive examinations. For students entering with a bachelor's degree, a maximum of two additional years will be added to this limit, for a maximum of seven years from admission to completion of all comprehensive examinations.

Transfer credits must be graduate credit taken at a regionally accredited institution and applicable to a graduate degree program without qualification at the originating institution. A master's student must earn a minimum of two-thirds of the credits required for the degree after formal admission to the graduate degree program at PSU and must earn a minimum of two-thirds of the credits required for the degree at PSU. Departments may have stricter limitations. Pre-admission credits taken at PSU and applied to master's degree requirements must be letter-graded B- or higher or graded Pass. Pre-admission or transfer credits taken at another institution and applied to master's degree requirements must be letter-graded B- or higher (Pass or similar grading methods are not acceptable). All pre-admission and transfer credits (whether taken at PSU or elsewhere) and applied to master's degree requirements must also meet all the following requirements: must not be used for any other degree at any institution (except for dual master's degrees ); must be no older than seven years old at the time the master's degree is awarded; and must total no more than one third of the required credits for a master' degree program. Otherwise eligible PSU credits applied toward a completed graduate certificate can be applied toward a subsequent master's degree without counting toward the pre-admission limits. For master's degrees, pre-admission credits taken at PSU are requested via a DARS exception submitted to the Graduate School. This request should be made soon after admission to the graduate program. Transfer courses from another regionally accredited institution are requested via the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21M) submitted to the Graduate School. It is strongly suggested that this form be submitted early in the student's program. (The M.S.W. program has specific transfer credit allowances resulting from accreditation requirements and inter-institutional agreements, but a minimum of 42 credits applied to the M.S.W. must be taken at PSU.) For graduate certificates, two-thirds of the required credits, or 15 credits minimum, whichever is larger, must be taken at PSU. Individual programs may set higher minimums. Transfer credits for graduate certificates must be letter-graded B- or higher (Pass or similar grading methods are not acceptable) and must be no older than seven years old at the time the graduate certificate is awarded. Transfer credits from other institutions must be approved by the graduate certificate program and the Graduate School using the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21M) . Students are encouraged to apply for and be admitted to graduate certificate programs as early as possible. For doctoral degrees, pre-admission and transfer limits are at the discretion of the individual doctoral programs; however, 603 Dissertation/606 Project credits, or their equivalent, cannot be transferred from another university. Transfer credits are requested via the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21D) submitted to the Graduate School. Approved graduate transfer courses from other institutions are not entered on PSU transcripts and are not considered in the computation of PSU cumulative graduate GPA. However, transfer courses are included in the approved program of study for all graduate certificate and degree programs and are used to calculate the program GPA, which must be 3.0 or higher in order to graduate.

Graduate Certificates A graduate certificate program is a linked series of approved graduate-level courses which constitute a coherent body of study with a specific defined focus within a discipline. Candidates for a graduate certificate must earn a minimum of 15 credits in approved graduate courses; many programs have higher minimums. A final project or portfolio may be required to provide for integration of the sequence of course materials. Master of Arts and Master of Science (M.A. and M.S.) The University offers programs leading to the Master of Arts and the Master of Science. These programs are designed to develop a mastery of subject matter in a chosen discipline and to provide training and experience in research. Candidates for the Master of Arts and Master of Science degrees must earn a minimum of 45 credits in approved graduate courses; many programs have higher minimums. A thesis may be required, depending on the program. The Master of Arts degree requires a demonstrated proficiency in a second language. Second language proficiency is not required for the Master of Science degree. Master of Arts in Teaching and Master of Science in Teaching (M.A.T. and M.S.T.) The Master of Arts in Teaching and Master of Science in Teaching degrees are designed to combine coursework in the major discipline with coursework in education. To this end, the programs are developed and administered within flexible guidelines to match the needs of students with varying backgrounds and professional plans. All M.A.T. degrees require a demonstrated proficiency in a second language. Second language proficiency is not required for the M.S.T. degree. A minimum of 45 graduate credits is required. The program of study includes the following: At least 24 graduate credits must be devoted to selected courses in academic fields which strengthen the candidate's scholarship in a teaching field and related area. This minimum may be higher at the department's discretion. At least 9 credits of courses in education are required. A final written and oral examination is required. Professional Master's Degrees PSU offers a variety of master's degrees which are designed to prepare students for work in professional fields. The programs are designed to develop a mastery of the subject matter in a chosen discipline and to provide practical training and experience in the field. Many professional master's degrees require more than the minimum 45 credits required for all master's degrees at PSU. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for scholastic achievement based upon the candidate's proven comprehensive knowledge in a specialized field of study and for creative scholarship through independent research. Judgment of such attainments is based upon the passing of comprehensive examinations and evaluation of a dissertation grounded in independent research. Professional Doctoral Degrees A professional doctoral degree is awarded for advanced knowledge and skills designed to address real-world problems. Students demonstrate readiness for completing a culminating project by passing comprehensive examinations. Students then address a problem of practice by completing a culminating project supervised by a combination of faculty and industry leaders.

There must be, at minimum, a three-year break in registration at PSU between the terms considered for Graduate Academic Forgiveness and the student's term of admission to a new graduate program. If Graduate Academic Forgiveness is approved, courses from the applicable terms will remain on the student's transcript and will be include in attempted hours, but the courses will be excluded from the earned, passed, and GPA hours. A notation on the transcript will identify the courses as excluded from the graduate GPA calculation. A maximum of three terms can be approved for Graduate Academic Forgiveness. Once Graduate Academic Forgiveness is processed and the courses excluded from the graduate GPA calculation, the action is irreversible. Graduate Academic Forgiveness is applied to all graduate courses in the approved terms, not just those with low grades. Courses approved for Graduate Academic Forgiveness cannot be used toward any current or future graduate degree or certificate requirements at PSU. A student who has previously been placed on graduate academic probation or disqualification at PSU is not eligible for Graduate Academic Forgiveness for the same program. Graduate Academic Forgiveness cannot be requested after a student has earned a graduate degree or certificate at PSU. A student may receive Graduate Academic Forgiveness only once during their time as a graduate student at PSU, regardless of how many graduate programs they may have participated in. If Graduate Academic Forgiveness is approved as part of the graduate admission process, the student will be admitted with University Conditional status. After admission, the student must earn a 3.0 graduate GPA or higher in their first 9 letter-graded graduate credits after admission. If the student earns a 3.0 GPA or higher, and has already been approved for Graduate Academic Forgiveness, the approved terms will be excluded from their graduate GPA calculation. If the need for Graduate Academic Forgiveness is identified post admission, the student must earn a 3.0 graduate GPA or higher in their first 9 letter-graded graduate credits after admission to their new graduate program before being eligible to apply for Graduate Academic Forgiveness. Responsibility for dropping courses It is the student's responsibility to drop courses they do not wish to attend. Non-attendance does not cancel the tuition charges nor prevent the course from appearing on the student's academic record. Non-completion of course A student who has participated in a course but has failed to complete essential work or attend examinations, and who has not communicated with the instructor, will be assigned the appropriate grade based on coursework completed. Incompletes Students do not have a right to receive/demand an Incomplete grade. The option of assigning an Incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor when the following criteria are met. Eligibility Criteria Required satisfactory course completion/participation . The quality of work is satisfactory, but some essential work remains. In addition, the student must have successfully completed most of the course work at the time the student requests the Incomplete, with a minimum grade up to that point of a B- for a graduate course. Reasonable justification for the request . Reasons for assigning the Incomplete must be acceptable to the instructor. A student does not have the right to demand an Incomplete. The circumstances should be unforeseen or beyond the control of the student. The instructor is entitled to request appropriate medical or other documentation to validate the student's request. Incomplete grade is not a substitute for a poor grade . The Incomplete grade is not meant to create the opportunity for special or additional work for a student to raise a poor grade, or for the opportunity to take the course over by sitting in on the course in a later term without registering or paying for it. Written agreement . A written or electronic agreement will be endorsed by both the instructor and student. The document will specify a) the remaining work to be completed, b) the highest grade which may be awarded upon submission of remaining items, and c) the date which the missing work is due. The latter may not exceed one year from the end of the term of enrollment for the given course. A template Incomplete Contract is available from the Registrar. Resolving the Incomplete . Instructors may not encourage students to \"sit in\" an entire future course in order to resolve the Incomplete grade. If the student needs to retake the entire course, they should be given the grade presently earned, and must formally register for the future class they will be attending. If the missed portion of the course is no longer available, instructors may offer an alternate assignment. Grading weight of the alternate assignment should not exceed the original assignment. Students are fully responsible for monitoring all due dates. Other Rules: GPA Calculation . Incomplete grades are not included when calculating GPA. Deadline for Completion . The deadline for completion of an Incomplete is one calendar year. The instructor may set a shorter deadline, which is binding. Any request for a longer deadline must be requested via petition to the Graduate Council. Failure to make up an Incomplete by the end of one year . The Incomplete will become part of the student's permanent academic record for a graduate course. Drops and withdrawals Drops/withdrawals from a course must be initiated by the student. It is the student's responsibility to drop/withdraw properly by the published deadlines dates . A student may drop with no record on the transcript up to the end of the second week of the term. As a courtesy, students are advised to notify the instructor concerned of the intended or completed drop. A student may withdraw for any reason before the end of the seventh week. Withdrawing in the third through seventh week will result in a \"W\" recorded on the transcript. A student wishing to withdraw after the seventh week must petition the Deadline Appeals Committee . A \"W\" is recorded if the petition is approved. Refunds are automatic and are calculated from the date of official drop/withdrawal. The refund is 100% only if the drop occurs within the first week of the term. The above deadlines refer to fall, winter and spring terms. For deadlines during summer session, consult the Registrar's Academic Calendar . No Basis for Grade (X grades) An X grade indicates No Basis for Grade and is used when there is little or no attendance and there is no work/performance upon which to base an academic evaluation. X grades cannot be changed after initial submission, and other grades cannot be changed to an X. An auditor may also be assigned an X for insufficient attendance. Missing Grade (M grades) If an instructor does not award a grade during the open grading window, an M grade (Missing) is automatically assigned. An M grade will change to a grade of X one term after the M was initially assigned. Once converted to an X, the grade cannot be changed. A graduate student will not be certified for graduation who has any M grades in PSU graduate courses that could potentially be letter graded, even if the courses are not applied to the student's degree. Audit (AU) Graduate students may take any course for which they have the prerequisites and which is open to them on the basis of their admission category on an audit (no-credit) basis. The tuition and fees for auditing courses are the same as for taking the courses for credit, but a student's load (total credit hours) does not include audit enrollments. Audited courses cannot be used to meet any requirement for degrees or certificates, for required registration for graduate assistants, or for scholarship students. Students cannot receive financial aid for audited courses. During the add-drop period, a student registered for a course for audit may change to credit status or vice versa through the official methods; thereafter, the change cannot be made. Academic record sealed after degree awarded PSU academic records are sealed thirty days after the conferral of a degree. After this date, no changes can be made to the academic record, such as removal of Incompletes or grade changes, except via petition to the Graduate Council. Catalog eligibility To earn a graduate degree, students must meet the degree requirements published in a single, valid PSU Bulletin (catalog). The requirements in a catalog are valid for seven years; for example, the 2023-24 Bulletin can be used through summer 2030 graduation. Students can only use a catalog year during which they were both admitted and enrolled. At the time a graduate program has a change to their curriculum approved, they may set more restrictive limits about which set of requirements (catalog year) can be used. Credit distribution and limitations Courses applied to any graduate certificate or degree program must be at the 500 or 600 level. Courses at the 700 and 800 level are not acceptable in any graduate certificate or degree programs, with the exception of 800-level courses in the master's degree programs in the College of Education as well as some M.A.T./M.S.T. programs; these programs may allow a maximum of 6 credits at the 800 level. Student teaching credits cannot be applied to a graduate degree or certificate. Students who take 400/500 courses at the 500 level must complete distinct requirements from those in the 400-level section. With the exception of coursework taken as part of a bachelors+masters program or pre-admission credits taken while still an undergraduate, graduate tuition is charged for all graduate-level coursework. At the master's level, a minimum of 12 credits in a 45-credit program must be taken in residence in 500, 500/600, or 600 course level categories. The remainder of the required credits may be 400/500 courses taken at the 500 level. Limitations are placed on the number of 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 508, and 509 credits that can be applied to master's degrees. In a 45-credit program, the limits are as follows: a maximum of 12 credits in 501, 502, and 505 combined; a maximum of 9 credits in 504, 508, and 509 combined; a range of 6 to 9 credits in 503. Courses numbered 60x are included in these limitations. Repeat of graduate courses If a graduate course is repeated, the grades awarded both times are included in the GPA. Repeating courses with the sole intent of raising the GPA is not acceptable. A graduate course cannot be repeated and applied to degree requirements twice unless the course has been approved as repeatable for credit. If a course offered as a 400/500 level course is taken for credit at the 400 level, the same course cannot be taken again for credit at the 500 level. Correspondence credit Under no circumstance will credit earned through correspondence study be acceptable toward a graduate degree or certificate. Academic load Full-time enrollment for graduate students is 9-16 credits. Graduate students must obtain approval for registration in excess of 16 credits (graduate and undergraduate credits combined) via the Overload Approva l form. A student registering for 17 to 19 credits must obtain the approval from their department chair or faculty adviser. A student registering for 20 credits or more must obtain the approval of their department chair and the Graduate School. A graduate assistant registering for more than 16 credits must obtain approval from their department chair and the Graduate School. Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering graduate students have a lower maximum registration limit of 10 credits. These students must obtain approval to register for 11 or more credits via the Overload Approval form. Minimum enrollment PSU requires that graduate students who are involved in activities requiring faculty time or the use of University facilities register every term (excluding summer), including those engaged in any phase of research, such as collecting or developing data, or when engaged in any aspects of a project, thesis, or dissertation. After advancement to candidacy, doctoral students must be continuously enrolled for a minimum of 1 graduate credit every term (excluding summer) through the term of graduation. A minimum of 1 graduate credit of registration is required in any term (including summer) when students are completing a major milestone for the degree such as taking any comprehensive or final examination, when holding a thesis/dissertation proposal or defense, and in the term of final thesis/dissertation submission and graduation. The student's department can require additional registration in any given term in relation to the amount of time required of faculty or the use of University facilities. Enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms Defenses and exams should be held during regular academic terms, i.e., not between terms. However, if it is necessary to hold a thesis/dissertation proposal or final defense, a final project presentation, or comprehensive/preliminary exams in the period between terms, and all faculty involved in the defense or exam have agreed to participate at this time, graduate programs are allowed to schedule defenses and exams between terms provided the following registration requirements are met by the student. Per the Minimum Enrollment policy, required registration for a defense or exam is a minimum of 1 graduate credit applicable to the degree. * For defenses and exams held between the end of fall term and the beginning of winter term, the student must be registered in the immediately preceding fall term. * For defenses and exams held between the end of winter term and the beginning of spring term, the student must be registered in the immediately preceding winter term. * For defenses and exams held between the end of spring term and the beginning of summer term, the student must be registered in the immediately preceding spring term. * For defenses and exams held between the end of summer term and the beginning of fall term, the student must be registered in the immediately succeeding fall term. * The Graduate School identifies summer term as the 8-week summer session defined by the university's Academic Calendar . For defenses/exams held during summer term, the student must be registered in one of the summer term sessions. Students should be aware that most faculty are not on contract over the summer and may not be available for defenses and exams in summer. Residency requirements Residence credit is defined as credit taken at PSU after formal admission to a graduate degree program. Residency requirements are intended to ensure that students work in close association with other graduate scholars in the intellectual environment of PSU. In a master's program, to meet the residency requirement a student must earn a minimum of two-thirds of the credits required for the degree after formal admission to a master's degree program at PSU. In a doctoral program, the residency requirement can be satisfied in one of the following ways: Three terms of full-time enrollment (minimum 9 graduate credits applicable to the degree program each term) during the first two years after admission to the program. This may include one or more summer terms. Six terms of part-time enrollment (minimum 1 graduate credit applicable to the degree program each term) during the first two years after admission to the program. This may include one or more summer terms. A doctoral student who was enrolled in the same major at PSU, and whose matriculation to the doctoral program immediately follows (within one calendar year) the master's degree program, may fulfill the residency requirement during the period in which the student was enrolled in the master's program. Pre-admission and transfer credit Courses taken at any institution, including PSU, before the term of formal admission to a PSU graduate degree program are pre-admission credits. Courses taken at any other institution at any time are transfer credits. Transfer credits must be graduate credit taken at a regionally accredited institution and applicable to a graduate degree program without qualification at the originating institution. A master's student must earn a minimum of two-thirds of the credits required for the degree after formal admission to the graduate degree program at PSU and must earn a minimum of two-thirds of the credits required for the degree at PSU. Departments may have stricter limitations. Pre-admission credits taken at PSU and applied to master's degree requirements must be letter-graded B- or higher or graded Pass. Pre-admission or transfer credits taken at another institution and applied to master's degree requirements must be letter-graded B- or higher (Pass or similar grading methods are not acceptable). All pre-admission and transfer credits (whether taken at PSU or elsewhere) and applied to master's degree requirements must also meet all the following requirements: must not be used for any other degree at any institution (except for dual master's degrees ); must be no older than seven years old at the time the master's degree is awarded; and must total no more than one third of the required credits for a master' degree program. Otherwise eligible PSU credits applied toward a completed graduate certificate can be applied toward a subsequent master's degree without counting toward the pre-admission limits. For master's degrees, pre-admission credits taken at PSU are requested via a DARS exception submitted to the Graduate School. This request should be made soon after admission to the graduate program. Transfer courses from another regionally accredited institution are requested via the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21M) submitted to the Graduate School. It is strongly suggested that this form be submitted early in the student's program. (The M.S.W. program has specific transfer credit allowances resulting from accreditation requirements and inter-institutional agreements, but a minimum of 42 credits applied to the M.S.W. must be taken at PSU.) For graduate certificates, two-thirds of the required credits, or 15 credits minimum, whichever is larger, must be taken at PSU. Individual programs may set higher minimums. Transfer credits for graduate certificates must be letter-graded B- or higher (Pass or similar grading methods are not acceptable) and must be no older than seven years old at the time the graduate certificate is awarded. Transfer credits from other institutions must be approved by the graduate certificate program and the Graduate School using the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21M) . Students are encouraged to apply for and be admitted to graduate certificate programs as early as possible. For doctoral degrees, pre-admission and transfer limits are at the discretion of the individual doctoral programs; however, 603 Dissertation/606 Project credits, or their equivalent, cannot be transferred from another university. Transfer credits are requested via the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21D) submitted to the Graduate School. Approved graduate transfer courses from other institutions are not entered on PSU transcripts and are not considered in the computation of PSU cumulative graduate GPA. However, transfer courses are included in the approved program of study for all graduate certificate and degree programs and are used to calculate the program GPA, which must be 3.0 or higher in order to graduate. Pre-admission and transfer credits from international institutions are subject to the same requirements and limitations. Requests for international pre-admission and transfer credits require additional documentation to facilitate verification of eligibility. Joint campus courses Admitted graduate students at PSU may take graduate courses offered by the University of Oregon or Oregon Health and Science University through the Joint Campus registration process. Joint Campus (JC) registration allows PSU students to have a graduate course from UO or OHSU included in their current term enrollment and tuition assessment at PSU. For additional details, see the Graduate School website . JC courses will be listed on the student's PSU transcript, however, JC courses are considered transfer credits for which all transfer credit limitations apply. After the course is completed, students will need to submit a GO-21 form to the Graduate School to request that the JC transfer credits be applied to their program of study at PSU. Course overlap between degrees and certificates In specific circumstances, coursework only (not a project, thesis/dissertation, comprehensive exam, or other culminating activity) can be shared between programs. There are limits on the use of eligible graduate courses between graduate programs. A graduate course that has been used to meet the requirements for a bachelor's degree or any undergraduate program cannot be applied to any graduate program (degree or certificate) unless the courses are part of a bachelors+masters program approved by the University, and the student has been admitted to that program. Graduate courses can be applied to two master's degrees only under the dual master's degrees allowance. Graduate courses can be applied to a master's degree and a doctoral degree provided the master's degree is awarded prior to or concurrent with the doctoral degree. Graduate courses can be applied to a master's degree and a graduate certificate. Graduate courses can be applied to a master's degree and a post-bac certificate. Graduate courses can be applied to a doctoral degree and a graduate certificate. Graduate courses can be applied to two graduate certificates unless both graduate certificates are included in a stackable degree program. Graduate courses can be applied to more than one doctoral program (at the discretion of both doctoral programs), but the following items must be completed at PSU for each doctoral degree: comprehensive exams, residency, proposal, advancement to candidacy, and dissertation research. Departments can set more restrictive limits. Bachelors+masters programs Bachelors+masters degree programs allow students to complete a bachelor's and master's degree at an accelerated pace. Students with upper-division standing may apply to an approved bachelors+masters degree program. The minimum institutional undergraduate GPA for admission to a bachelors+masters program cannot be less than 3.30; beyond the GPA minimum, individual programs will set their own admissions criteria. Students admitted to an approved bachelors+masters program can share a maximum of 20 graduate credits between a bachelor's and master's degree. Programs may choose to allow fewer shared credits. Shared credits will be considered pre-admission credits when applied to the master's degree. After admission to a bachelors+masters degree program, students must maintain an institutional undergraduate GPA of 3.30 and earn a B or higher in graduate courses taken for shared credit. Students in a bachelors+masters program who are pursuing their first bachelor's degree will be assessed undergraduate tuition for the graduate credits earned while working toward the bachelor's degree. Upon completion of the bachelor's degree, students who meet those requirements will be guaranteed admission to the master's program with shared credits. Students who do not meet those requirements would need to apply for admission to the master's degree program without the benefits of bachelors+masters shared coursework. Dual master's degrees A student may work toward the completion of the requirements for two PSU master's degrees in complementary disciplines or toward a master's degree at PSU and a partner university when there is a formal agreement between the two institutions. Dual master's degrees allow for sharing of credits between the two degrees. The credits to be shared between both master's degrees cannot exceed one-third of the required credits for a degree. If the two degrees have different total credit requirements, the one-third limit is determined by the smaller total credit requirement. Only coursework can be shared between two master's degrees; comprehensive exam, internship, practicum, project, thesis, or other culminating activity cannot be shared. Students are limited to one use of one dual master's degree allowance at PSU. Dual degree credits must be approved by the student's departments and the Graduate School with a Dual Degree Form (GO-14) . Leave of absence An admitted graduate student in good academic standing may request a leave of absence. A leave of absence (LoA) is a hiatus of a student's studies during which they are not registered and are not engaged in any phase of research or aspects of an exam, project, thesis, or dissertation. A leave of absence provides a guarantee that the student will be allowed to return to their graduate program at the agreed-upon time and exempts the student from the continuous enrollment requirement (applicable only to advanced Ph.D. students). However, a leave of absence does not constitute a waiver of the time limit for completion of a graduate program nor the one-year limit for completion of a course. A leave of absence is granted for a specific time period, up to a maximum of three terms (excluding summer). Students may request more than one leave of absence but all leaves combined cannot exceed six terms. A student with an approved leave of absence cannot: register for any coursework; engage in any phase of research or aspects of an exam, project, thesis, or dissertation; or engage in any activities that require faculty time or use of University resources. It is the student's responsibility to drop or withdraw from all courses as well as notify other appropriate offices on campus of their leave status (e.g. Financial Aid). A Graduate Leave of Absence Request must be submitted to the Graduate School no later than the Friday of the second week of the term for which the leave of absence should take effect. A leave of absence will not be approved retroactively. Re-enrollment Admitted graduate students who fail to enroll for credits for three consecutive terms (excluding summer) must submit a Graduate Re-Enrollment Request to their department. If this request is supported by their department, the form is signed and forwarded to the Graduate School for processing. To ensure timely registration, the completed Graduate Re-Enrollment Request should be received by the Graduate School no later than three weeks prior to the start of the term the student wishes to re-enroll. Per Executive Order 13607, students who are re-enrolling after an interruption due to military service can re-enroll in the same program, with the same enrollment status and the same academic standing, which they had when the military service began if they wish. The period of military service and an additional period of up to three years (limited to five years total), may be excluded from standard University time limits. Students must notify the Graduate School that they are returning from military services (and present appropriate documentation) so that the possible impact on time limits can be identified. Cancellation of admission to graduate program If a student does not validate admission by registering and paying for at least 1 credit at PSU in the term of admission, that admission will be canceled unless the student contacts Graduate Admissions and requests that the admission be updated to another term within a one-year period. If the student does not validate admission within a one-year period, the admission will be canceled and the student must submit a new application and a new application fee. A student with validated admission to a graduate certificate or degree program who during a one-year period (1) does not have an approved leave of absence and (2) does not successfully complete a graduate course in the approved program of study for the degree OR does not make satisfactory progress toward the degree (as determined by the department) may have admission to the degree program canceled. Additionally, a doctoral student who has not been registered for three years will have admission to the degree program canceled. For further information, students are urged to contact individual departments for departmental policies and practices. Faculty as student policy PSU faculty members are encouraged to pursue additional advanced degrees at other institutions. Faculty members above the rank of instructor are not eligible to receive an advanced degree in their own department or school at the University; however, in special circumstances, they may earn a degree in a department or school in which they do not hold an appointment. Academic Standing All admitted graduate certificate and degree students at PSU must maintain good academic standing during the course of their graduate program. Good academic standing is defined as maintaining a cumulative graduate GPA of 3.00 or higher in all graduate credits earned at PSU. All graduate students, especially those in a conditional admission status, are expected to keep in close communication with their departments and to avail themselves of departmental advising. Academic probation An admitted graduate student is placed on probation if their cumulative graduate GPA at PSU, based on the completion of 9 or more letter-graded graduate credits after admission to the graduate level at PSU, falls below 3.00. While on academic probation a student will not be permitted to graduate, to be admitted to a new or different graduate certificate or degree program, to be advanced to doctoral candidacy, to have a thesis or dissertation committee appointed, to receive or continue to hold a graduate assistantship, or to register for more than a total of 9 credit hours in any term. A student is removed from academic probation if their cumulative graduate GPA is brought up to 3.00 or higher once they have completed the next 9 letter-graded graduate credits after beginning probation status. Academic disqualification Disqualification occurs if: A student on academic probation fails to achieve a cumulative graduate GPA of 3.00 or higher once they have completed the next 9 letter-graded graduate credits after beginning probation status; or A student becomes subject to academic probation for a second time. A student who is disqualified may not register for any graduate courses at PSU. Readmission after disqualification Readmission after disqualification is not automatic. A disqualified student may petition for readmission as a student in a graduate certificate or degree program after one calendar year. Readmission after the mandatory one-year period is initiated by the student's filing of a petition for readmission to the Graduate Council through the Graduate School. Such a petition would need to address the circumstances that led to disqualification and provide evidence of preparedness to resume graduate study. If a student's graduate program recommends readmission, the Graduate Council may grant readmission, with or without additional academic requirements, or may recommend continued disqualification. A readmitted student must raise the cumulative graduate GPA to 3.00 or higher within the first 12 letter-graded credits after readmission or the student will be disqualified. Graduate courses completed at other institutions while a student is under disqualification at PSU will not be applied toward a graduate program at PSU.

The number of students admitted to a particular program is limited to the resources and space available in each program. All applicants for a graduate degree or certificate program must meet minimum University admission requirements as well as departmental requirements. University admission requirements include: A bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution Minimum GPA. To be considered for Regular admission, applicants must have a minimum cumulative undergraduate GPA of 2.75 or the equivalent (on the U.S. 4.0 scale) from the degree granting institution(s). Applicants who have earned 9 or more letter-graded graduate credits must have a minimum graduate GPA of 3.0 or the equivalent; this graduate GPA supersedes the undergraduate GPA. Applicants who have a cumulative undergraduate GPA between 2.5 and 2.74 or the equivalent from the degree granting institution(s) are eligible for University Conditional status. After completing 9 letter-graded graduate credits at PSU with a GPA of 3.0 or higher, students with University Conditional status will automatically be given Regular status.

This process may only be initiated by a department. International applicants must also submit: Copies of official degree certificates/diplomas Certified translation of transcripts and degree certificates/diplomas Financial documentation demonstrating adequate financial support for at least the first year of study Depending on the individual graduate program, additional departmental requirements may include: Personal essay or statement of purpose Letters of recommendation Standardized test scores, e.g. GRE or GMAT Resume Writing samples Portfolio Information regarding departmental requirements can only be obtained directly from the specific department. Three-Year Bridge program This program is an alternate method of meeting graduate admission requirements. It is designed for international students coming from non-Bologna-compliant three-year baccalaureate degree programs recognized by the Ministries of Education in their home countries. This program comprises approximately one year of academic study intended to bridge the differences between the applicant's degree and a four-year U.S. baccalaureate degree. Students are invited to participate in this program only if they have been recommended for admission by their departments. 1. Students graduating from international educational institutions with thirteen years of pre-collegiate work, 'A-level' passes, and three-year bachelor's degrees are directly admissible to PSU graduate programs if they meet all other university requirements. 2. As a general principle, students with twelve years of pre-collegiate education and three-year bachelor's degrees are admissible to graduate programs at PSU only if they complete one additional year of acceptable coursework. a. When additional coursework is required for admission to graduate study, specific courses must be approved by the Graduate School, in consultation with appropriate program/college officials. b. Coursework is a year's duration and totals 30 - 42 credit hours, with 16 graduate credits that can be applied towards a graduate degree. 3. 'Special Action' exceptions of Graduate School Conditional Admission could waive the additional year of additional work describe in #2. Requests will be considered on the basis of acceptable evidence that the applicant is judged by appropriate campus authority to possess sufficient academic, professional and other potential pertinent to the applicant's educational objectives to merit such action. 'Special Action' exceptions require submission of additional information. Examples of additional information needed to support the request for Special Action admission are: a. Test score results (GRE general and/or specialty tests; GMAT; departmental placement examinations) b. Completion of one year of college-level work at a regionally accredited U.S. university in a field related to the field of application c. Department faculty evaluation of a portfolio of the student's work in the field (e.g., published articles, research, creative work, relevant awards, professional licensure) d. Department faculty evaluation of coursework taken at the international university (review of syllabi, reading lists, prerequisite preparation, recommendations) and of English communication skills e. Commitment of individual faculty members who will act as advisors to the student. 4. All special approval admissions requests under either #2 or #3 above must be initiated by the department and processed through the Graduate School's admissions system. Requests should include support for why special consideration should be considered. 5. When additional coursework is required for admission to graduate study, specific courses must be approved by the Graduate School, in consultation with appropriate program/college officials. Coursework is a year's duration and totals 30 - 42 credit hours, with 16 of these credits countable towards the graduate program. 6. Admission to Portland State University to complete graduate admission preparation (#2) or with a 'Special Action' exemption (#3) does not confer 'baccalaureate possession' rights or privileges acceptable either for the seeking of an American teaching credential or for transfer to graduate programs at other U.S. higher education institutions. Moreover, students so admitted will not be eligible to earn a baccalaureate degree at the University.

A few graduate certificates require an omnibus course (e.g., 506 Project) as a culminating activity for the program. Apart from these required credits, courses numbered 501/601 through 509/609 are typically not allowed in graduate certificate programs. Experimental courses (i.e., courses numbered 510/610) can substitute for electives at the program's discretion, but all core courses must be fully approved. All graduate certificates are approved with a minimum number of required credits. These minimum credit totals cannot be waived even if the approved program of study exceeds the University minimum of 15 credits for a graduate certificate. Graduate certificate students must have a minimum 3.00 GPA on all courses applied to the program of study, as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in all graduate-level courses taken at PSU, in order to graduate. Departments may establish a more rigorous standard. Although grades of C+, C, and C- are below the graduate standard, they may be counted as credit toward a graduate certificate with the specific written approval of the program. Grades of D or F indicate clearly unacceptable work and cannot be applied to graduate certificate requirements. Audited courses cannot be used to meet any requirement for graduate certificates. Courses completed up to seven years prior to the certificate award date may be used to satisfy graduate certificate requirements (e.g., a course started in the fall term of 2016 will be beyond the seven-year limitation at the close of fall term 2023). For graduate certificates, transfer credit is defined as any eligible letter-graded (B- or higher) graduate course taken at another regionally accredited institution. Two-thirds of the credits required for a graduate certificate, or 15 credits minimum, whichever is larger, must be taken at PSU. Individual programs may set higher minimums. See the section on Course overlap between degrees and certificates for use of coursework in certificate programs. Students must apply for graduation by the first Friday of the anticipated term of graduation; see the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific due dates. There is a required $30 fee per application as well as a $2 service charge. As a one-time courtesy, students who do not complete certificate requirements can have their application for graduation carried forward to a future term (typically the next term, but it could be at maximum up to one year in advance). To request that an application for graduation be carried, students must contact the Graduate School in writing and provide an explanation for the graduation delay. If students do not graduate a second time, the application for graduation will be dropped; they will then need to reapply for graduation by the appropriate deadline (and will be assessed a new application fee). Master's degrees Second language requirement The second language requirement for M.A. and M.A.T. students must be met before any final exam is taken or final graduation paperwork can be approved. The Department of World Languages and Literatures has determined that the second language requirement for M.A. and M.A.T. students can be met in the following ways: Equivalent coursework: Students who have passed a course equivalent to PSU level 203 or higher in a second language will be deemed to have met the language requirement. The Graduate School will certify completion upon evaluation of the student's academic record if the requirement was completed at PSU. If the requirement was completed at a different institution, the Department of World Languages and Literatures will issue a certificate of completion. M.A. and M.A.T. students are responsible for making their academic records available in the first term of admission and requesting evaluation and certification. Students who do not meet the requirement under 1. above should make an appointment with the Department of World Languages and Literatures during the first term after their admission to make an individualized plan for the completion of their language requirement. Options include preparing for and passing one of these evaluations: Oral proficiency interview A written test such as The Graduate Student Foreign Language Test The CLEP exam A special exam, administered by the Department of World Languages and Literatures Coursework after admission: taking a course at level 203 or above in residence or abroad Special reading courses, if available. The Department of World Languages and Literatures will teach and test only in languages in which it has expertise. However, off-campus arrangements may be possible with the cooperation of other institutions and the approval of the chair of the Department of World Languages and Literatures. Certification of having passed a second language examination from an institution other than PSU must be approved by the Department Chair of World Languages and Literatures. A student whose native language is not English may meet the second language requirement in English, except for students in the M.A. in World Languages and Literatures, who are required to demonstrate fluency in two foreign languages other than English at the time of admission and are not required to demonstrate additional competency except as necessary to complete their degree requirements. Coursework and program of study In the first year a student should prepare a proposed program of study in consultation with an adviser. The purpose of the planned program of study is to present an organized, individualized plan for coursework, practica, and research activities consistent with the requirements for the proposed degree and approved by the adviser. If PSU pre-admission credits are to be included on the program of study, the department must submit a DARS exception to the Graduate School. If transfer credits (courses taken at any time from another regionally accredited institution) are to be included on the program of study, the Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21M) must be submitted to the Graduate School for approval. See Pre-admission and transfer credit for detailed information. All master's degrees are approved with a minimum number of required credits. These minimum credit totals cannot be waived even if the approved program of study exceeds the University minimum of 45 credits for a master's degree. A student must have a minimum 3.00 GPA on the courses applied to the program of study, as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in all graduate-level courses taken at PSU, in order to graduate. Departments may establish a more rigorous standard. Although grades of C+, C, and C- are below the graduate standard, they may be counted as credit toward a master's degree with the specific written approval of the department if taken at PSU after the term of formal admission to the graduate program. Grades of D or F indicate clearly unacceptable work and cannot be applied to graduate degree requirements. Audited courses cannot be used to meet any requirement for master's degrees. A grade of IP (In Progress) may be used for 501 Research and for 506 Project when a student is progressing in an acceptable manner toward completion of the work; final grades for 501 and 506 credits are submitted by the instructor via an online grade change. An IP grade must be used for 503 Thesis when a student is progressing in an acceptable manner; final grades for 503 credits are assigned by the instructor on the Recommendation for the Degree form (GO-17M) and posted to the student's transcript after approval of the thesis and certification for graduation by the Graduate School. All coursework applied to the master's degree program must be completed within the seven years prior to the awarding of the degree (e.g., a course started in the fall term of 2016 will be beyond the seven-year limitation at the close of fall term 2023). Degree application Students must apply for graduation by the first Friday of the anticipated term of graduation; see the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific due dates. There is a required $30 fee per application as well as a $2 service charge. As a one-time courtesy, students who do not complete degree requirements can have their application for graduation carried forward to a future term (typically the next term, but it could be at maximum up to one year in advance). To request that an application for graduation be carried, students must contact the Graduate School in writing and provide an explanation for the graduation delay. If students do not graduate a second time, the application for graduation will be dropped; they will then need to reapply for graduation by the appropriate deadline (and will be assessed a new application fee). Human Research Protection Program All research involving human subjects conducted by faculty, staff, or students in any program at PSU must have Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) approval. This policy applies to all research under the auspices of the University, including surveys and questionnaires, whether supported by grant, contract, gift, University, or personal funds. The student should allow a minimum of six weeks for the approval process. A student cannot have a thesis committee appointed until HRPP approval is granted. Final examination If a final examination is required by the student's department, it must be taken after successful completion of any required second language examination and after at least 30 credits have been completed. The examination is not a re-examination over coursework but rather a test of the candidate's ability to integrate material in the major and related fields, including the work in any thesis or research project. A minimum of 1 graduate credit of registration is required when taking any final oral or written examination. Oral examinations In the case of a non-thesis oral examination, the committee must consist of at least two members of the student's department, including the student's adviser. At the discretion of the department, a faculty member from another department may be added. For M.A.T. and M.S.T. students, one additional member of the committee is required to be a faculty member from the College of Education or a faculty member with pedagogical expertise in the student's discipline. A non-thesis final oral examination (including a final project presentation) should be held during a regular academic term. If necessary, a final examination can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . Examinations must be scheduled and completed by the Friday of finals week for graduation in that term. For summer term graduation, the deadline applies to the regular eight-week summer session dates, i.e., exams must be scheduled and completed by the Friday of the eighth week of summer term. Passing of the final oral examination requires a majority approval. If the student fails the entire examination or any section thereof, the department may dismiss the student from the master's program or permit the student to repeat the entire examination, or the section that was failed, after a minimum of three months. The results of the second examination are final. Written examinations If a final written examination is required, it should be held during a regular academic term. If necessary, a final examination can be scheduled between terms, see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . Examinations must be scheduled and completed by the Friday of finals week for graduation in that term. For summer term graduation, the deadline applies to the regular eight-week summer session dates, i.e., exams must be scheduled and completed by the Friday of the eighth week of summer term. If the student fails the entire examination or any section thereof, the department may dismiss the student from the master's degree program or permit the student to repeat the entire examination, or the section that was failed, after a minimum of three months. The results of the second examination are final. Thesis The presentation of a thesis as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the master's degree is required in certain departments and is an option in others. Each school, college, and department defines the nature of research and scholarship accepted for a thesis, but in all cases a high level of resourcefulness, productivity, and mature perception of the discipline is expected. The quality of the culminating work must meet University standards and reflect those of other leading universities. Although the thesis is not required to show original results, it must reveal independent investigation, including the knowledge and application of the accepted methods of scholarship and research methodology. The thesis represents the independent work of the student and must be developed under the direction of the thesis adviser. The thesis committee must be approved by the Graduate School using the Appointment of Master's Thesis or Doctoral Dissertation Committee form (GO-16) in advance of the thesis defense. Master's thesis committees must consist of at least three and not more than five faculty members. The chair of the thesis committee must be regular, full-time PSU instructional faculty, tenured or tenure track, assistant professor or higher in rank; the other two to four committee members may be non-tenure track or adjunct faculty. Two of the committee members (the committee chair and one other member) must be from the student's department; the third member may be from the student's department or may be PSU faculty from another department or OHSU faculty. If it is necessary to go off campus for one additional committee member with specific expertise not available among PSU faculty, a CV for that proposed member must be submitted with the GO-16 form; this member must be in addition to the required three PSU faculty members. All committee members must have master's degrees or higher. No thesis defense shall be valid without a thesis committee approved by the Graduate School. The GO-16 form must be submitted to the Graduate School by the appropriate deadline for the intended term of graduation; see Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific dates. Students must be registered for at least 1 graduate credit in every term in which they are working on any phase of their thesis, including data development or collection, writing, revision, defense, and finalization through approval by the Graduate School. Students must register for at least 6 to 9 credits of 503 Thesis in their department. (Since students must be continuously enrolled while working on the thesis, they may accumulate more than 9 credits of 503 Thesis. However, a maximum of 9 credit of 503 Thesis may be applied to the program of study.) IP (In Progress) is the interim grade reported until the thesis is defended and approved by the student's thesis committee. Final grades for 503 Thesis credits are assigned by the instructor on the Recommendation for the Degree form (GO-17M) and posted to the student's transcript after approval of the thesis and certification for graduation by the Graduate School. A thesis defense should be scheduled during a regular academic term, no later than five weeks prior to the close of the term of application for graduation in which the degree will be granted (i.e., must be completed four weeks before the beginning of finals week). For summer term graduation, deadlines apply to the regular eight-week summer session dates. Later completion will result in graduation in a subsequent term. If necessary, a thesis defense can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . The student must deliver a final draft of the thesis to all members of the approved committee no fewer than 14 days before the thesis defense. See Oral Defenses of Theses and Dissertations for additional information on defense policies and procedures. A thesis defense must take place in a meeting with the student and the entire, appointed committee. While it is expected that all members should be physically present, remote participation is permitted under specific conditions . The student's oral presentation should not exceed 60 minutes. The thesis defense is open to the University faculty and may be open to the public at the department's discretion. Passing of the thesis defense requires a majority approval. If the student fails the thesis defense, the department may dismiss the student from the master's program or permit the student to hold a second defense after a minimum of three months. The results of the second defense are final. After passing the thesis defense, the student will be required to make any necessary edits and revisions. The final, post-defense version of the thesis must be approved by committee members by signing the Thesis Signature Page. For final approval, a majority of committee members must sign the Thesis Signature Page . The final thesis must be submitted to the Graduate School not later than three weeks prior to the close of the term of application for graduation. See the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific dates. For details about thesis formatting and submission, see the Thesis and Dissertation Information available from the Graduate School. Doctoral degrees Preliminary examinations Early in the doctoral program the student may be required to take preliminary examinations. The scope and content of the examination, and the standard of performance, is determined by the doctoral program. Preliminary exams should be held during regular academic terms. If necessary, preliminary exams can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . Advisory committee When a student enters the doctoral program, a faculty adviser will be designated by the program to advise the student and to meet in regular consultation concerning the program of study and research. It is recommended that students also have an advisory committee appointed that should consist of at least three faculty members representative of the student's field of study. The members of the advisory committee should be appointed after successful completion of 9 credits and not later than six months prior to the completion of the comprehensive examinations. Language requirement For the Ph.D. degree, the student may be required to demonstrate competency in at least one second language. Any second language requirement must be completed before the comprehensive examinations. Professional doctoral programs do not have a second language requirement. Residency requirement Residency for a doctoral degree program can be satisfied in one of the following ways: Three terms of full-time enrollment (minimum 9 graduate credits applicable to the degree program each term) during the first two years after admission to the program. This may include one or more summer terms. Six terms of part-time enrollment (minimum 1 graduate credit applicable to the degree program each term) during the first two years after admission to the program. This may include one or more summer terms. A doctoral student who was enrolled in the same major at PSU, and whose matriculation to the doctoral program immediately follows (within one calendar year) the master's degree program, may fulfill the residency requirement during the period in which the student was enrolled in the master's program. Coursework and doctoral program of study The doctoral program of study includes coursework, research, internships, and/or seminar credits according to the requirements of the individual doctoral program. A minimum of three academic years of graduate study beyond the bachelor's degree (equivalent to 81 quarter credits minimum) is required for all doctoral degrees. A minimum 27 credits of 603 Dissertation is required for all Ph.D. students; a minimum of 18 credits of 606 Project is required for all professional doctoral students. All doctoral degrees are approved with a minimum number of required credits. These minimum credit totals cannot be waived even if the approved program of study exceeds the University minimum of 81 credits for a doctoral degree. For doctoral degrees, pre-admission and transfer limits are at the discretion of the individual doctoral programs; however, 603 Dissertation/606 Project credits, or their equivalent, cannot be transferred from another university. Transfer credits are approved via a Proposed Transfer Credit form (GO-21D) submitted to the Graduate School. See Pre-admission and transfer credit for detailed information. While potentially all coursework for the degree can be transferred from another institution, the following items must be completed at PSU: comprehensive exams, residency, proposal, advancement to candidacy, and dissertation/project research. A student must have a minimum 3.00 GPA on the courses applied to the program of study, as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in all graduate-level courses taken at PSU, in order to graduate. Doctoral programs may establish a more rigorous standard. Although grades of C+, C, and C- are below the graduate standard, they may be counted as credit toward a doctoral degree with the specific written approval of the doctoral program. Grades of D or F indicate clearly unacceptable work and cannot be applied to graduate degree requirements. Audited courses cannot be used to meet any requirement for doctoral degrees. A grade of IP (In Progress) may be used for 601 Research and for 606 Project when a student is progressing in an acceptable manner toward completion of the work; final grades for 601 and 606 credits are assigned by the instructor via an online grade change. An IP grade must be used for 603 Dissertation when a student is progressing in an acceptable manner; final grades for 603 Dissertation credits are assigned by the instructor on the Recommendation for the Degree form (GO-17D) and posted to the student's transcript after approval of the dissertation and certification for graduation by the Graduate School. All coursework on the program of study, with the possible exception of seminar and internships, must be completed before a Ph.D. student can be advanced to doctoral candidacy. All coursework on the program of study must be satisfactorily completed before graduation. For students entering a Ph.D. program with a master's degree, a maximum of five years will be allowed from admission to completion of all required comprehensive examinations. For students entering a Ph.D. program with a bachelor's degree, a maximum of two additional years will be added to this limit, for a maximum of seven years from admission to completion of all comprehensive examinations. For students entering a professional doctoral program, a maximum of four years will be allowed from admission to completion of all required comprehensive examinations. Failure to meet these time limits will result in cancellation of admission to the doctoral program. Comprehensive examination Before advancement to candidacy and not less than one academic year before all requirements for the doctoral degree are expected to be completed, the student must pass a series of comprehensive examinations in the field of specialization. The examinations may be written, oral, or both. The comprehensive examinations may not be taken until the language requirement, if any, and substantially all the coursework for the degree have been completed. Students must be registered for a minimum of 1 graduate credit during the term comprehensive exams are taken. Comprehensive exams are scheduled and administered in accordance with the established rules of the program, which must be made publicly available to students via the program's website or doctoral student handbook. Comprehensive exams should be held during regular academic terms. If necessary, comprehensive exams can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . The doctoral program must notify the Graduate School the student has passed comprehensive exams by submitting the Report on Passing Comprehensive Examinations form (GO-22) . If the student fails the entire comprehensive exam or any section thereof, the doctoral program may dismiss the student from the degree program or permit the student to repeat the entire examination, or the section that was failed, after a minimum of three months. The results of the second examination are final. For Ph.D. students, a maximum of three years will be allowed from the completion of comprehensive examinations to advancement to candidacy. For professional doctoral students, a maximum of five years will be allowed from the completion of comprehensive examinations to graduation. Failure to meet these time limits will result in cancellation of admission to the doctoral program. Culminating Project Professional doctoral students will complete a culminating project in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. After passing the comprehensive examination and identifying a culminating project topic, a project committee is appointed. The project committee will take the place of the advisory committee and the faculty adviser is superseded by the project adviser. The culminating project committee must consist of three to five members. The chair must be a PSU tenure track or non-tenure track faculty member. Potentially all of the regular committee members can be off-campus members. At least two committee members (the chair and a regular member) must have doctoral degrees. At the discretion of the program, the designation of co-chair can be used for one regular member of the committee. The designation of co-chair recognizes the significant academic advising role of the committee member, but oversight of the process and procedures and all administrative responsibilities remains with the chair. A proposal is not required for a culminating project, but some programs may develop their own internal proposal process. Professional doctoral students are not advanced to candidacy, but they are required to obtain Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) approval if appropriate (see below). With guidance from the culminating project committee, the student prepares a project designed to address a problem of practice. Until the degree is granted, the student enrolls for the number of graduate credits appropriate to the amount of University services utilized, as determined by the project chair, with a minimum of 1 graduate credit each term. Professional doctoral students must register for 18 credits of 606 Project before graduation. For professional doctoral students, a maximum of five years will be allowed from the completion of comprehensive examinations to graduation. Individual programs may have stricter limits. Failure to meet this time limit will result in cancellation of admission to the doctoral program. Dissertation proposal Ph.D. students will complete a dissertation in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. After passing the comprehensive examination and identifying a dissertation topic, a dissertation committee is appointed and the student must pass a proposal defense (some programs refer to the proposal defense as a prospectus or colloquium). The dissertation committee will take the place of the advisory committee and the faculty adviser is superseded by the dissertation chair. The dissertation committee must be approved by the Graduate School using the Appointment of Master's Thesis or Doctoral Dissertation Committee form (GO-16) . Ph.D. dissertation committees must consist of at least four and not more than six faculty members. The chair of the dissertation committee must be regular, full-time PSU instructional faculty, tenured or tenure track, assistant professor or higher in rank; the other three to five committee members may include non-tenure track or adjunct faculty and/or members of the OHSU faculty. If it is necessary to go off campus for a committee member with specific expertise not available among PSU faculty, a CV for that proposed member must be submitted with the GO-16 form; this off-campus member may substitute for one of the three to five regular committee members. All committee members must have doctoral degrees. At the discretion of the program, the designation of co-chair can be requested on the GO-16 form for one regular member of the committee. The designation of co-chair recognizes the significant academic advising role of the committee member, but oversight of the process and procedures and all administrative responsibilities remains with the chair. No proposal defense shall be valid without a dissertation committee approved by the Graduate School. The GO-16 form should be submitted to the Graduate School a minimum of six weeks in advance of the estimated date of the dissertation proposal meeting. The student must deliver a draft of the dissertation proposal to all members of the approved committee no fewer than 14 days before the proposal defense. A dissertation proposal should be scheduled during a regular academic term. If necessary, a dissertation proposal can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . A dissertation proposal must take place in a meeting with the student and the entire, appointed committee. While it is expected that all members should be physically present, remote participation is permitted under specific conditions . The student will make an oral presentation of the written proposal for discussion, evaluation, and suggested modification. The final proposal submitted to the committee for approval should be sufficiently detailed and clear to provide a blueprint for the study to follow. The proposal is expected to include the following: General nature and present status of knowledge of the problem. The theoretical and empirical framework within which the proposed problem exists. The significance of the proposed research and its likely contributions. The research methodology to be used. The Ph.D. program recommends the student for advancement to candidacy once the dissertation proposal has been approved. Human Research Protection Program All research involving human subjects conducted by faculty, staff or students in any program at PSU must have Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) approval. This policy applies to all research under the auspices of the University, including surveys and questionnaires, whether supported by grant, contract, gift, University, or personal funds. After proposal approval, the student must submit a HRPP application to the Office of Research Integrity if human subjects are involved in the research in any way. A student cannot be advanced to candidacy until HRPP approval is granted. The student should allow a minimum of six weeks for the approval process. Advancement to Candidacy A student is advanced to candidacy after successful defense of the dissertation proposal and with the recommendation of the Ph.D. program, after verification of the student's program of study, and after HRPP approval has been granted (if applicable). The Ph.D. program must request advancement by submitting the Request for Advancement to Candidacy form (GO-23) to the Graduate School. The Dean of the Graduate School retains final approval authority for advancement to candidacy. A doctoral candidate has a minimum of four months and a maximum of five years from the effective date of advancement to candidacy to complete all requirements for graduation, including defense of the dissertation and its final approval by the Graduate School (doctoral programs may have stricter requirements). Candidates must be continuously enrolled during that period. Failure to meet this time limit will result in cancellation of admission to the doctoral program. Dissertation preparation With guidance of the dissertation committee, the candidate presents a dissertation setting forth the results of original and independent investigation. The dissertation must constitute a contribution to knowledge, significantly enlarging, modifying, or reinterpreting what was previously known. Until the degree is granted, the student enrolls for the number of graduate credits appropriate to the amount of University services utilized, as determined by the dissertation adviser, with a minimum of 1 graduate credit each term. Ph.D. students must register for a minimum of 27 credits of 603 Dissertation before graduation. Continuous enrollment of a minimum 1 graduate credit is required through the term a student graduates, even if this results in more than 27 credits of 603 Dissertation at the time of graduation. Ph.D. students should only register for 603 Dissertation credits after advancement to candidacy. Degree application All doctoral students must apply for graduation by the first Friday of the anticipated term of graduation; see the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific due dates. There is a required $30 fee per application as well as a $2 service charge. As a one-time courtesy, students who do not complete degree requirements can have their application for graduation carried forward to a future term (typically the next term, but it could be at maximum up to one year in advance). To request that an application for graduation be carried, students must contact the Graduate School in writing and provide an explanation for the graduation delay. If students do not graduate a second time, the application for graduation will be dropped; they will then need to reapply for graduation by the appropriate deadline (and will be assessed a new fee). Dissertation defense After preparation of the written dissertation, the candidate's dissertation committee will conduct a dissertation defense. A dissertation defense should be scheduled during a regular academic term, no later than five weeks prior to the close of the term of application for graduation in which the degree will be granted (i.e., must be completed four weeks before the beginning of finals week). For summer term graduation, deadlines apply to the regular eight-week summer session dates. Later completion will result in graduation in a subsequent term. If necessary, a dissertation defense can be scheduled between terms; see information about enrollment for defenses and exams held between terms . The student must deliver a final draft of the dissertation to all members of the approved committee no fewer than 14 days before the dissertation defense. See Oral Defenses of Theses and Dissertations for additional information on defense policies and procedures. The dissertation defense, which is open to the public, is the culminating experience in the student's Ph.D. studies. The candidate is expected to prepare an oral presentation on the research methodology and results. The oral presentation should not exceed 60 minutes. Following the oral presentation, the candidate must defend the dissertation as a worthy contribution to knowledge in its field and must demonstrate a mastery of the field of specialization as it is related to the dissertation. The questioning and discussion are for the purpose of further enlightenment of the candidate and the committee on the significance and limitations of the research and demonstration that the candidate has met the high expectations of the University for the awarding of the doctoral degree. A dissertation defense must take place in a meeting with the student and the entire, appointed committee. If there is a need to update dissertation committee membership from what was originally approved on the GO-16 form, the update must be approved by the Graduate School before the final defense. While it is expected that all members should be physically present, remote participation is permitted under specific conditions . For dissertation approval, there may be no more than one dissenting vote on the dissertation defense. If the student fails the dissertation defense, the doctoral program may dismiss the student from the program or permit the student to hold a second defense after a minimum of three months. The results of the second defense are final. After passing the dissertation defense, the student will be required to make any necessary edits and revisions. The final, post-defense version of the dissertation must be approved by committee members by signing the Dissertation Signature Page . For final approval, there may be no more than one committee member who does not approve the final, post-defense version of the dissertation by not signing the Dissertation Signature Page. The final dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School not later than three weeks prior to the close of the term of application for graduation. See the Graduation Dates and Deadlines for specific dates. For details about thesis formatting and submission, see the Thesis and Dissertation Information available from the Graduate School. Time limitations Time limitations for Ph.D. students: For students entering a Ph.D. program with a master's degree, a maximum of five years will be allowed from admission to completion of all required comprehensive examinations. For students entering with a bachelor's degree, a maximum of two additional years will be added to this limit, for a maximum of seven years from admission to completion of all comprehensive examinations. Individual programs may have stricter requirements. Failure to meet this time limit will result in cancellation of admission to the program.

Applicants who have earned 9 or more letter-graded graduate credits must have a minimum graduate GPA of 3.0 or the equivalent; this graduate GPA supersedes the undergraduate GPA. University Conditional status Applicants who have a cumulative undergraduate GPA between 2.5 and 2.74 or the equivalent from the degree-granting institution(s) are eligible for University Conditional status. Students admitted with University Conditional status must achieve a 3.0 cumulative graduate GPA, based on all graduate courses taken at PSU, once they have completed 9 letter-graded graduate credits after admission. Students who meet the University Conditional status GPA requirement will automatically be converted to Regular status. Students with University Conditional status who do not earn a cumulative graduate GPA of 3.0 or higher once completing 9 letter-graded graduate credits at PSU after admission will have their admission canceled. Department Conditional status Department Conditional status may be imposed on a student who has a deficiency in departmental requirements. These conditions may include GPA requirements or additional coursework and may be more rigorous than University Conditional status or other University standards. Department Conditional status is removed once a department determines the appropriate requirements have been met. Students who do not fulfill the requirements of their Department Conditional status can have their admission canceled by the department. Both University Conditional and Department Conditional status Students who have both University Conditional status and Department Conditional status are subject to all of the policies stated above.

There must be, at minimum, a three-year break in registration at PSU between the terms considered for Graduate Academic Forgiveness and the student's term of admission to a new graduate program. If Graduate Academic Forgiveness is approved, courses from the applicable terms will remain on the student's transcript and will be include in attempted hours, but the courses will be excluded from the earned, passed, and GPA hours. A notation on the transcript will identify the courses as excluded from the graduate GPA calculation. A maximum of three terms can be approved for Graduate Academic Forgiveness. Once Graduate Academic Forgiveness is processed and the courses excluded from the graduate GPA calculation, the action is irreversible. Graduate Academic Forgiveness is applied to all graduate courses in the approved terms, not just those with low grades. Courses approved for Graduate Academic Forgiveness cannot be used toward any current or future graduate degree or certificate requirements at PSU. A student who has previously been placed on graduate academic probation or disqualification at PSU is not eligible for Graduate Academic Forgiveness for the same program. Graduate Academic Forgiveness cannot be requested after a student has earned a graduate degree or certificate at PSU. A student may receive Graduate Academic Forgiveness only once during their time as a graduate student at PSU, regardless of how many graduate programs they may have participated in.

Eligibility To determine students' eligibility for assistance, the following estimated direct and indirect expenses are used to create the students' Cost of Attendance: tuition and fees, books and supplies, housing and meals, transportation and personal/miscellaneous expenses. Because the Cost of Attendance uses average amounts, it may not reflect students' actual costs. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships provides eligible students with financial aid in the form of grants and scholarships, employment and loans. Underlying the awarding of financial aid at PSU is the nationally accepted philosophy that parents are the primary source responsible for helping their dependent students meet their educational costs. The amount of the contribution expected from parents is based on a family's financial strength as indicated by taxed and untaxed income, household size, number in college, and assets. Both dependent and independent students have a responsibility to make a reasonable contribution toward their costs from earnings and savings. Financial aid resources serve to supplement these primary resources and are intended for educational expenses only. Financial aid eligibility is calculated using a formula determined by federal law. Students should apply annually using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA can be filed online at www.fafsa.gov . PSU's federal school code to be used on the FAFSA is 003216. Applications for Aid Applications for financial aid must be submitted annually for the academic year and/or summer aid. The academic year at Portland State University begins with fall term and ends after summer term. While the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships accepts FAFSA data at any time during the year, priority is given to admitted applicants who submit their FAFSA as soon as possible after October 1st, and who provide all requested information promptly. It is recommended that students apply no later than February 1st each year. It is not necessary to wait for formal admission to the University before submitting the financial aid application. Scholarship applications are only accepted within the scholarship application open and close dates. In order to be eligible to receive federal, state or institutional financial aid, students must remain in good academic standing as defined in the University Scholastic Standards Policy and by the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy requirements described at the end of the Financial Aid section. The student must be officially admitted to an aid-eligible degree or certificate program, and must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen as defined by federal regulations. Students may not receive aid beyond established limits, which include a rate of course completion, a maximum time frame, as well as annual and aggregate dollar amounts. Information about each aid program is available at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/types-aid . Undergraduate students Eligible undergraduate students may receive consideration for financial assistance through the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Federal TEACH Grant, Federal Work-Study, and Federal Direct Loan programs. Oregon resident students may also be eligible for the Oregon Opportunity Grant. Eligible parents of dependent students may borrow a Federal Direct PLUS Loan through the Federal Direct Loan Program, described in the Educational Loans section. Post-baccalaureate students Eligible post-baccalaureate students may receive consideration for financial assistance through the Federal Direct Loan Program. Parents of dependent post-baccalaureate students may borrow a Federal Direct PLUS Loan through the Federal Direct Loan Program, described in the Educational Loans section. Graduate students Eligible graduate students may receive consideration for financial assistance through the Federal TEACH Grant, and Federal Direct Loan Program, which includes Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans. International students International students are not eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs but are eligible for certain scholarships offered through PSU. Award Notification An Award Notification will indicate the types and amounts of financial aid from all sources for which the student is eligible, along with the terms and conditions of receiving and using the funds awarded. Award amounts will be displayed on the PSU student account at my.pdx.edu . Students must review and accept the terms and conditions for specific awards if necessary, then accept or decline aid in an offered status. Delivery of Aid After the financial aid award is accepted and all requirements have been completed, available financial aid will be credited to the student account to pay tuition and other billed charges for enrolled students each term. Financial aid that exceeds billed charges is then delivered to the student by the Portland State University Student Financial Services Office according to the preference that the student has established with the University. See www.pdx.edu/student-finance/financial-wellness-center for more information. Federal Work-Study is earned on a monthly basis and paychecks are issued at the end of each month by the University's payroll office. Students may authorize direct deposit of their Federal Work-Study earnings to their bank account. More information can be found at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/financial-aid/apply . Aid Disbursement Policy Financial aid can begin being disbursed to a student's Portland State University revolving charge student account up to ten days prior to the start of each term. Aid will only disburse if a student's registered enrollment level matches their award enrollment level for the term, and there are no outstanding requirements. The ability to disburse aid prior to the beginning of a term means that the University must have a \"census date\" that is used to finalize a student's official aid eligibility for a term. Census dates for the 2022-2023 aid year and minimum enrollment requirements for the various financial aid programs can be found on the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships website at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/eligibility . At the census date of each term each student's enrollment is \"locked\" and considered to be final. Financial aid for that term may then require adjustment based on their enrollment level at that time. When a reduction in aid is required due to a student's reduced enrollment level at the census date the reduction can create a balance due on the student's PSU account. If there is a tuition refund because of dropped credits, the tuition refund will be used to reduce the balance due on the student's account. Students applying to borrow a federal student loan must be enrolled in a minimum of halftime credit hours, have demonstrated need and/or eligible costs to receive a disbursement from the federal student loan programs. Students who have received a disbursement of a federal student loan and then reduce enrollment below half-time at any point will be required to complete federal student loan exit counseling. The PSU Registrar's Office will report the less than half time enrollment status to the federal student loan servicer which will result in the loss of In School Deferment status. All prior federal student loans for a borrower who does not qualify for in school deferment will enter the grace period or repayment if a grace period was previously used. Students who regain eligibility to borrow from the federal student loan programs by increasing enrollment after the census date for any term must notify the Office of Student Financial Aid by submitting a Revision Request form to update their enrollment plan and request a reinstatement of their federal student loan. Any current term aid disbursed after the census date will be based on the student's enrollment on the census date, or their actual number of credits enrolled at the time of disbursement, depending on type of aid. Credits added after the census date cannot be used to increase aid eligibility. Retroactive aid (aid for a term that has ended prior to disbursement) must be disbursed based on completed grades/credit hours, or census date registration, whichever is less. This includes retroactive grants and loans. Grades that are considered \"complete\" for disbursement purposes are: A, B, C, D, F (if earned through course participation), P, I or IP. Withdrawals--Official/Unofficial Please see the annual Registration Guide, or visit www.pdx.edu/registration , for the university policy regarding dropping classes and tuition refunds. Students who withdraw completely during the term and are receiving federal, state, or institutional financial aid may have a percentage of their aid reversed based on federal regulations and institutional policies. These students will have any unearned portion of their aid charged back to their PSU account, and may owe repayment directly to the U.S. Department of Education of any overpaid federal grants. Federal student aid recipients who begin attending classes and then stop attending prior to the end of the quarter are considered by the federal government to have unofficially withdrawn. For students who receive grades of X, M, NP, W or F in all of their classes, we must determine whether they unofficially withdrew. If University records indicate that a student unofficially withdrew from the quarter, the University will consider the withdrawal date to be the last date of attendance or participation in class by the student midpoint of the quarter as determined by the University. If University records show a federal student aid recipient never attended any class or performed any academically related activity for a quarter or term, then the recipient never established eligibility for any federal aid funds that may have been disbursed for that quarter or term. The student must repay the entire amount of ineligible aid disbursed for that term. Any student aid recipient who drops all classes or voids their schedule with an effective date prior to the first day of class for a quarter or term did not establish eligibility for any funds that may have been disbursed for that quarter or term. More information can be found at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/eligibility . Award Sources Comprehensive details on the federal aid programs are available online at www.studentaid.gov . Students and families can also find Financial Aid consumer information and guides at www.pdx.edu/student-finance . Educational Grants Federal Pell Grant This federally funded grant program is designed to provide assistance to eligible undergraduate students. The federal government determines the amount of the grant with the University acting as the disbursing agent. Eligibility is determined by the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) that results from the student's FAFSA data. Students have a lifetime limit that is the equivalent of 6 years of full-time enrollment for Federal Pell Grant eligibility. Students apply for this grant by completing the FAFSA. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) This is a limited federally funded grant program available to Federal Pell Grant recipients who have the lowest EFCs. Students apply for this grant by completing the FAFSA. Oregon Opportunity Grant All Oregon resident undergraduate students applying for financial aid will be considered for the Oregon Opportunity Grant awarded by the State of Oregon's Office of Student Access and Completion (OSAC). Awards are based upon financial need. Details about eligibility can be found at www.oregonstudentaid.gov . Awards are renewable for up to 12 terms provided satisfactory academic progress and financial need continue each academic year. Oregon students apply for this grant by completing the FAFSA, or, if not eligible to complete the FAFSA, the Oregon Student Aid Application (ORSAA). The ORSAA can be found at www.oregonstudentaid.gov . Federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant This grant provides up to $4,000 per year to graduate and undergraduate students who intend to teach full-time as a highly qualified teacher in high-need subject areas for at least four years at schools that serve students from low-income families. Graduate students may receive up to $8,000 for graduate study. Undergraduate students may receive up to $16,000 for undergraduate study. Part-time students are eligible, but the maximum grant will be reduced. Students apply for this grant by completing the FAFSA. Important Notice: If TEACH Grant recipients fail to complete the four-year teaching obligation, they must repay the grant with interest under the Federal Direct Loan program. Tuition Grants, Scholarships, and Remissions There are a variety of school funded programs that provide tuition assistance to eligible students. Students apply for these institutional programs by completing the FAFSA. More information can be found at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/financial-aid/grants . Athletic Grants-In-Aid and Scholarships Athletic grants-in-aid and scholarships are administered by the institution's financial aid and athletic departments. Each head coach is responsible for selecting recipients based upon eligibility and athletic ability. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sets forth the eligibility and financial aid requirements for Portland State University athletic teams. Any prospective PSU student should contact the coach of the desired sport about the availability of scholarships and the recruiting process. Each coach will then consider the prospective student's athletic ability, eligibility, finances available, and the need of that particular sport. An athletic grant-in-aid request is then submitted to the director of Athletics for award to the prospective student. Educational Loans Federal Direct Loan Program Portland State University participates in the Federal Direct Loan program. Under this program, funding for student loans comes from the U.S. Treasury and are disbursed by schools. When loan repayments are due, borrowers repay them directly to the federal government through a loan servicer assigned by the U.S. Department of Education. Any subsequent loans are then serviced by the assigned loan servicer. Undergraduate and post-baccalaureate students can borrow Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans; graduate students can borrow Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans; and parents of dependent students can borrow Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loans. Federal Direct Loan applicants must submit a FAFSA to have their loan eligibility determined. After their loans have been awarded, they must accept them as part of their financial aid award acceptance process, and complete Master Promissory Note and satisfy entrance counseling requirements at www.studentaid.gov . Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan Subsidized loan eligibility is based upon the demonstration of financial need and in conjunction with other sources of student assistance. The federal government pays the interest on this loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time and during the six-month grace period directly after a student separates from school. For students who are new borrowers after July 1, 2013, interest is paid by the federal government up to 150 percent of the published length of the academic program. The student is responsible for all interest on the loan once repayment begins or after 150 percent of the published length of the academic program is exceeded. The federal government has set annual borrowing limits of $3,500 for the first academic year of undergraduate study (up to 44 credits); $4,500 for the second academic year (45-89 credits); and $5,500 an academic year for the remaining years of undergraduate study. Not all students are eligible for the maximum loan amount. Student borrowers must be enrolled in good standing at least half-time and have been accepted for admission to a program leading to a degree or eligible certificate. Once repayment begins, borrowers are charged the interest rates that were in effect for each year they borrowed. For current interest rates, visit the Department of Education's website at www.studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates . Students must complete a FAFSA each year to participate in this loan program. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan This program provides unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans to undergraduate and graduate students who do not demonstrate federally defined need. Unsubsidized loans are not eligible for the federal government payment of interest while the student is in school. The student may make interest-only payments while in school, or the interest will be added to the loan balance upon entering repayment. The interest rates for the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan are specific to each year that the student borrows. For current interest rates, visit the U. S. Department of Education's website at h www.studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates . Students are responsible for the interest that accrues while in school, during their six-month grace period, and during any authorized deferment periods. The federal government has set annual borrowing limits of $2,000-$5,500 for the first academic year of undergraduate study (up to 44 credits); $2,000-$6,500 for the second academic year (45-89 credits); and $2,000-$7,500 an academic year for the remaining years of undergraduate study. Undergraduate borrowing limits vary based on the borrower's dependency status as indicated by the FAFSA. Graduate students may borrow up to $20,500 per year. Lifetime (aggregate) Federal Direct Loan Borrowing Limits by Academic Program A student may borrow up to an aggregate limit of $31,000 (only $23,000 may be subsidized) as a dependent undergraduate or post baccalaureate student; $57,500 as an independent undergraduate or post baccalaureate student (only $23,000 of this amount may be subsidized); and $138,500 as a graduate or professional student (only $65,500 of this may be subsidized). The aggregate amount for graduate students includes all previous loans borrowed as an undergraduate or post baccalaureate student. Additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Dependent undergraduate students whose parents' Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan applications are denied may be eligible for additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Students who have earned fewer than 90 credits may borrow up to $4,000 a year in additional funds above the maximum Federal Direct Loan annual limits (but may not exceed aggregate limits). Students who have earned 90 credits or more may borrow up to an additional $5,000 per year (but may not exceed aggregate limits). Not all applicants will qualify for the maximums in additional funding. The Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan may be used to replace the Expected Family Contribution, but total Federal Direct Loan (subsidized and unsubsidized) borrowing, plus other financial assistance received, cannot exceed the Cost of Attendance. Students must complete a FAFSA each year to participate in this loan program. Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan (PLUS) This program provides loans to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Parents may borrow up to an annual amount that is equal to the Cost of Attendance minus any financial assistance the student receives during the periods of enrollment. The parent borrower may use the amount of the Federal Direct PLUS to replace the Expected Family Contribution and cover unmet need for the loan period. The Federal Direct PLUS Loan is limited to parents who do not have adverse credit history or who have obtained an endorser who does not have adverse credit history. A servicer, contracted by the federal government, performs the required credit check. The interest on the Federal Direct PLUS Loan is fixed. For current interest rates, visit the U.S. Department of Education's website at www.studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates . Parents interested in participating in the Federal Direct PLUS Loan program can apply online at www.studentaid.gov . Students must complete a FAFSA each year for their parent to participate in this loan program. Federal PLUS Loan for Graduate and Professional Students (Graduate PLUS) This program is available to credit-qualified graduate students with or without financial need. Repayment begins within sixty days after the Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan is fully disbursed. Students who meet deferment requirements may obtain an in-school deferment from the U.S. Department of Education. Interest is fixed for each loan, and begins to accrue at the time the first disbursement is made. For current interest rates, visit the Department of Education's website at www.studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates . Students must complete a FAFSA each year to be eligible for Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans. Private Alternative Loans Privately funded education loans are not based on need, and no federal formula is applied to determine eligibility. The amount borrowed cannot exceed the Cost of Attendance minus other financial aid, including other loans. Interest rates and repayment terms vary by lender, and should be carefully considered when making borrowing decisions. Privately funded education loans may be used to supplement the federal programs when the cost of attendance minus the maximum federal aid still leaves unmet need. For information on alternative loans, visit the PSU website at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/financial-aid/apply . Loan Repayment Repayment of Federal Direct Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) begins after the grace period, which is six months after the student withdraws or graduates from school, or has been enrolled less than half-time. Repayment of Federal Direct PLUS Loans begins within sixty days of the last disbursement. There are no penalties for making payments while in school or during the grace period. Students or parents may make payments at any time directly to their loan servicer. Entrance and Exit Counseling First-time Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loan and Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan borrowers must complete entrance counseling, which focuses on a borrower's rights and responsibilities and provides information about responsible borrowing. Shortly before graduating or enrolling in less than half time credit hours at Portland State University, borrowers must also complete student loan exit counseling. Both entrance and exit counseling are completed online at www.studentaid.gov . Debt Management and Default Reduction Portland State University is committed to helping students with sound financial planning and debt management. Information about loans, repayment options, and debt management strategies is available in the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships at www.pdx.edu/student-finance and through the Financial Wellness Center in the Student Financial Services office at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/financial-wellness-center .

On-campus jobs are available with nearly every academic and administrative department. Off-campus jobs are available with government agencies and nonprofit groups; many are community service jobs that involve directly serving the community while providing a good work experience. The America Reads program, which tutors young children in public schools, is one of these programs. The Portland State University Career Center lists openings for on-campus and off-campus jobs at www.pdx.edu/careers . More information can be found at www.pdx.edu/student-finance . Scholarships Portland State University has a number of scholarships which are administered by individual academic departments, the PSU General Scholarship committee, or special committees developed for specific scholarships. Scholarships generally are awarded on the basis of academic achievement or promise, and financial need. More information can be found at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/scholarships . Satisfactory Academic Progress and Financial Aid To be eligible for federal, state or institutional aid students must make satisfactory academic progress (SAP), as defined by federal regulations, toward completion of their program of study. Portland State University monitors the following: 1) student's course completion rate which is a percentage calculated by taking the number of PSU + transfer credits passed divided by PSU + transfer credits attempted but not passed, according to student level; 2) grade point average (GPA) for PSU + transfer courses, according to student level; and 3) maximum time frame for PSU courses + accepted transfer credits. The maximum time frame for undergraduate students is 270 attempted credits. The maximum time frame for post-baccalaureate students is 90 attempted credits. The maximum time frame for graduate students is established according to the student's degree or program. Repeated coursework: students may only receive aid once for repeating a previously passed class; students may receive aid for multiple repeats of failed classes as long as they maintain compliance with satisfactory academic progress requirements. Multiple withdrawals: financial aid recipients who withdraw from all of their classes, or who receive all non-passing grades in their classes TWICE within the school year, will have their financial aid eligibility suspended. Graduate students must take courses at the appropriate level; at least 67% of all credits enrolled in during each academic year must be graduate level courses. Students who do not meet all requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy during a term will be placed on Financial Aid Warning; students who do not meet all requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy during a second term will have their eligibility for financial aid suspended. Students whose eligibility is suspended may submit a written appeal. Students who appeal successfully will be placed on Financial Aid Probation and may need to submit and follow an academic plan.

Interest is fixed for each loan, and begins to accrue at the time the first disbursement is made. For current interest rates, visit the Department of Education's website at www.studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates . Students must complete a FAFSA each year to be eligible for Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans. Private Alternative Loans Privately funded education loans are not based on need, and no federal formula is applied to determine eligibility. The amount borrowed cannot exceed the Cost of Attendance minus other financial aid, including other loans. Interest rates and repayment terms vary by lender, and should be carefully considered when making borrowing decisions. Privately funded education loans may be used to supplement the federal programs when the cost of attendance minus the maximum federal aid still leaves unmet need.

Portland State University monitors the following: 1) student's course completion rate which is a percentage calculated by taking the number of PSU + transfer credits passed divided by PSU + transfer credits attempted but not passed, according to student level; 2) grade point average (GPA) for PSU + transfer courses, according to student level; and 3) maximum time frame for PSU courses + accepted transfer credits. The maximum time frame for undergraduate students is 270 attempted credits. The maximum time frame for post-baccalaureate students is 90 attempted credits. The maximum time frame for graduate students is established according to the student's degree or program. Repeated coursework: students may only receive aid once for repeating a previously passed class; students may receive aid for multiple repeats of failed classes as long as they maintain compliance with satisfactory academic progress requirements. Multiple withdrawals: financial aid recipients who withdraw from all of their classes, or who receive all non-passing grades in their classes TWICE within the school year, will have their financial aid eligibility suspended. Graduate students must take courses at the appropriate level; at least 67% of all credits enrolled in during each academic year must be graduate level courses. Students who do not meet all requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy during a term will be placed on Financial Aid Warning; students who do not meet all requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy during a second term will have their eligibility for financial aid suspended. Students whose eligibility is suspended may submit a written appeal. Students who appeal successfully will be placed on Financial Aid Probation and may need to submit and follow an academic plan.

Award amounts will be displayed on the PSU student account at my.pdx.edu . Students must review and accept the terms and conditions for specific awards if necessary, then accept or decline aid in an offered status. Delivery of Aid After the financial aid award is accepted and all requirements have been completed, available financial aid will be credited to the student account to pay tuition and other billed charges for enrolled students each term. Financial aid that exceeds billed charges is then delivered to the student by the Portland State University Student Financial Services Office according to the preference that the student has established with the University. See www.pdx.edu/student-finance/financial-wellness-center for more information. Federal Work-Study is earned on a monthly basis and paychecks are issued at the end of each month by the University's payroll office. Students may authorize direct deposit of their Federal Work-Study earnings to their bank account. More information can be found at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/financial-aid/apply . Aid Disbursement Policy Financial aid can begin being disbursed to a student's Portland State University revolving charge student account up to ten days prior to the start of each term. Aid will only disburse if a student's registered enrollment level matches their award enrollment level for the term, and there are no outstanding requirements. The ability to disburse aid prior to the beginning of a term means that the University must have a \"census date\" that is used to finalize a student's official aid eligibility for a term. Census dates for the 2022-2023 aid year and minimum enrollment requirements for the various financial aid programs can be found on the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships website at www.pdx.edu/student-finance/eligibility . At the census date of each term each student's enrollment is \"locked\" and considered to be final. Financial aid for that term may then require adjustment based on their enrollment level at that time. When a reduction in aid is required due to a student's reduced enrollment level at the census date the reduction can create a balance due on the student's PSU account. If there is a tuition refund because of dropped credits, the tuition refund will be used to reduce the balance due on the student's account. Students applying to borrow a federal student loan must be enrolled in a minimum of halftime credit hours, have demonstrated need and/or eligible costs to receive a disbursement from the federal student loan programs. Students who have received a disbursement of a federal student loan and then reduce enrollment below half-time at any point will be required to complete federal student loan exit counseling. The PSU Registrar's Office will report the less than half time enrollment status to the federal student loan servicer which will result in the loss of In School Deferment status. All prior federal student loans for a borrower who does not qualify for in school deferment will enter the grace period or repayment if a grace period was previously used. Students who regain eligibility to borrow from the federal student loan programs by increasing enrollment after the census date for any term must notify the Office of Student Financial Aid by submitting a Revision Request form to update their enrollment plan and request a reinstatement of their federal student loan. Any current term aid disbursed after the census date will be based on the student's enrollment on the census date, or their actual number of credits enrolled at the time of disbursement, depending on type of aid. Credits added after the census date cannot be used to increase aid eligibility. Retroactive aid (aid for a term that has ended prior to disbursement) must be disbursed based on completed grades/credit hours, or census date registration, whichever is less. This includes retroactive grants and loans. Grades that are considered \"complete\" for disbursement purposes are: A, B, C, D, F (if earned through course participation), P, I or IP. Withdrawals--Official/Unofficial Please see the annual Registration Guide, or visit www.pdx.edu/registration , for the university policy regarding dropping classes and tuition refunds. Students who withdraw completely during the term and are receiving federal, state, or institutional financial aid may have a percentage of their aid reversed based on federal regulations and institutional policies. These students will have any unearned portion of their aid charged back to their PSU account, and may owe repayment directly to the U.S. Department of Education of any overpaid federal grants. Federal student aid recipients who begin attending classes and then stop attending prior to the end of the quarter are considered by the federal government to have unofficially withdrawn. For students who receive grades of X, M, NP, W or F in all of their classes, we must determine whether they unofficially withdrew. If University records indicate that a student unofficially withdrew from the quarter, the University will consider the withdrawal date to be the last date of attendance or participation in class by the student midpoint of the quarter as determined by the University. If University records show a federal student aid recipient never attended any class or performed any academically related activity for a quarter or term, then the recipient never established eligibility for any federal aid funds that may have been disbursed for that quarter or term. The student must repay the entire amount of ineligible aid disbursed for that term. Any student aid recipient who drops all classes or voids their schedule with an effective date prior to the first day of class for a quarter or term did not establish eligibility for any funds that may have been disbursed for that quarter or term.

Because the Cost of Attendance uses average amounts, it may not reflect students' actual costs. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships provides eligible students with financial aid in the form of grants and scholarships, employment and loans. Underlying the awarding of financial aid at PSU is the nationally accepted philosophy that parents are the primary source responsible for helping their dependent students meet their educational costs. The amount of the contribution expected from parents is based on a family's financial strength as indicated by taxed and untaxed income, household size, number in college, and assets. Both dependent and independent students have a responsibility to make a reasonable contribution toward their costs from earnings and savings. Financial aid resources serve to supplement these primary resources and are intended for educational expenses only. Financial aid eligibility is calculated using a formula determined by federal law. Students should apply annually using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA can be filed online at www.fafsa.gov .

A current, detailed listing of term course offerings can be found in the online Class Schedule at www.sa.pdx.edu/soc . Detailed instructions for registration, priority registration dates, drop and add deadlines and academic calendar can be found online at www.pdx.edu/registration . The class schedule is available approximately eight weeks before the beginning of classes for winter and spring, and available in May for the following fall term. The academic calendar contains deadlines related to adding and dropping classes, making grade changes, withdrawing from classes, and refund percentages. These deadline dates are important as they determine the extent of financial obligation incurred by registration activity and they determine if and how a course registration will be recorded on a student's transcript. Students who withdraw or drop may be entitled to certain refunds of fees paid. See the Academic Calendar at www.pdx.edu/registration/academic-calendar . Non-attendance Students are responsible for dropping courses they do not wish to attend. Non-attendance does not cancel tuition charges, nor does it prevent the course and grade from appearing on the student's academic record. The University reserves the right to drop students who do not attend classes or do not have the proper prerequisites. Some academic departments administratively drop student who not not attend class on the first class meeting. If this happens, the student 1) remains responsible for any tuition charges associated with the registration, and 2) the course may be recorded permanently on the academic record, depending on when the department processes the drop. Students with mitigating circumstances who cannot attend class on the first day should notify the instructor or academic department as soon as possible to avoid being administratively dropped. Note: Students receiving state or federal aid who receive all X, M, NP, W, or F grades for a term whose attendance during that term cannot be verified, are subject to having all their funds returned. Academic Advising Requirements Advising at Orientation All new undergraduates, both freshmen and transfer students, are required to participate in New Student Orientation where they will learn about Portland State University's academic curriculum and resources, connect with an academic advisor and be given permission to register for their first term at Portland State. Orientation http://www.pdx.edu/ admissions/orientation First-year Advising Requirement All newly admitted undergraduates are required to connect with their assigned advisor within the first two terms of enrollment in order to register for their third term. For example, students admitted in fall term must receive advising during fall or winter terms in order to enroll for spring term or a hold will prevent them from being able to register. First-Year Advising Requirement: www.pdx.edu/advising/first-year-mandatory-advising Find Your Advisor: http://www.pdx.edu/advising/advising-locations Residency Classification At PSU tuition for Oregon residents is different from that of non-residents. The rules used in determining residency seek to ensure that only bona fide Oregon residents are assessed the resident fee. The Residency Standards used to assess residence classification may be found at www.pdx.edu/registration/residency-requirements . Only the Office of Admissions and the Residency Officer have authority to apply and interpret these rules and procedures. No other indication or determination of residency by any other institutional office, department, program, or staff represents the official institutional determination of residency. Residency Classification Appeals A student may appeal their residency determination by submitting a Residence Information Affidavit with the Residency Officer in the Office of the Registrar. Information about the appeal process may be found at www.pdx.edu/registration/residency-review . Undergraduate Students Returning to PSU After an Absence Former Portland State University students who have been absent for two or more terms, and/or attended another college or university since leaving PSU should complete the online Re-enrollment Request Form at www.pdx.edu/registration/re-enrollment . Official transcripts must be submitted from each institution attended since leaving PSU. Part-Time Students/Non-Degree Students Part-time and non-degree students are subject to the same rules as full-time and admitted students with regard to Academic Standards (academic warning, probation, dismissal) and registration deadlines (drop, add, tuition refunds, grade option changes etc.). Tuition payment is required by published deadlines. Part-time students Part-time status is defined as enrollment in fewer than 12 credit hours for undergraduates, and fewer than 9 credits for graduate students. Credit work taken as a part-time student is acceptable for undergraduate degrees and credentials. A fully admitted student may earn most University degrees as a part-time student. Part-time students should meet regularly with an adviser for academic planning and information on up-to-date requirements and University policies. Non-degree/non-admit students A student may take a maximum of 8 credits in fall, winter and spring terms, and 21 in summer without applying for formal admission. A Non-Degree Entry form is used to create a student record and provide access to the registration system. There is a one time, nonrefundable fee. Non-degree students do not qualify for financial aid nor do they receive transfer credit evaluations. Non-degree students are allowed to preregister after admitted students. Students may apply online, or obtain a Non-Degree Entry form at www.pdx.edu/admissions/non-degree-applicant . Students who wish to take 9 or more credits in fall, winter, or spring terms must be formally admitted to the University. Students who plan to earn a degree at PSU should be admitted as soon as possible. Regardless of how many credits are earned while in non-degree status, there is no guarantee of admission. Formal admission is required to earn a degree. Postbaccalaureate Status Students seeking admission who have earned an accredited baccalaureate degree, who have not been admitted to a graduate degree program may be admitted and enroll at the postbaccalaureate level. These students are admitted to Portland State to earn a second bachelor's degree, certificate, complete pre-requisites for admission to graduate school, or take other academic credit. PSU students who have completed an undergraduate degree who wish to complete a second undergraduate degree or take 9 or more credits during fall, winter or spring terms or more than 21 in the summer, must be admitted to postbaccalaureate status. Postbaccalaureate students are subject to the same academic policies as undergraduates. Senior Citizen Enrollment PSU waives tuition for courses audited by an Oregon resident 65 years of age or older if: space is available after degree-seeking students have registered the instructor or department approve, and the auditing student is a non-degree-seeking student and is registered for 8 or fewer credits per term. One-time administrative fees (e.g., $25 for program enrollment) and additional course-specific fees for materials and online access may apply. Registration, advising, and enrollment support are provided through the Senior Adult Learning Center (SALC). The tuition waiver does not apply to courses with Restricted Differential Tuition. Seniors taking classes for credit pay tuition according to the established tuition schedule. SALC receives no direct financial support from either the State of Oregon or PSU. The program relies on charitable contributions from Senior Auditors and other friends of SALC. For further information, please email SALC (salc@pdx.edu) or visit the SALC website ( www.pdx.edu/senior-adult-learning-center ). Veteran Educational Benefits Certification 503-725-8380 Most programs at Portland State University are approved for the training of veterans. The Veterans Administration requires that any veteran receiving GI Bill(r) benefits while attending PSU is required to obtain transcripts from all previously attended schools and submit them to the VA School Official for review for prior credit. Transcripts submitted from all previously attended schools to the Admission Office will be accessible to the VA School Official. It is not necessary to submit two copies. Each term, after registration, veteran students intending to use their education benefits must submit the Online Veterans Certification form. Course adds, drops, withdrawals, class cancellations and changes of program made after submitting the veterans certification form must be reported as soon as possible to the Veterans Certification Office, FMH Lobby. GI Bill(r) is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. Academic Credit for Military Training After admission, credit may be granted for some types of military service courses on the college level where equivalency to Portland State courses can be shown, as informed by the ACE recommendations. Veterans should provide transcripts from appropriate military schools and a copy of VA form DD214 to the Veterans Certification unit of the Office of the Registrar upon application to PSU. Veteran Priority Registration Portland State University offers early, priority registration to students using veterans' educational benefits and to veterans and military members who submit appropriate documentation. Priority registration supports timely program completion in compliance with Oregon House Bill 2565. Students being certified by the Registrar's Office for federal VA educational benefits will automatically be given veteran priority registration. Other veteran and military members can submit a copy of the DD-214 issued under honorable or general conditions to show proof of service in order to be enrolled in veteran priority registration. Submit DD214 to o the Veteran Certification Office in the FMH Lobby or to vetcert@pdx.edu. Satisfactory Progress Standards In order to maintain satisfactory progress, the student veteran must complete the following credits: Certified for: Undergraduate: Graduate: Full time 12+ credits 9+ credits Three-quarter time 9 - 11 credits 7 - 8 credits One-half time 6 - 8 credits 5 - 6 credits The cumulative GPA at Portland State University required to maintain satisfactory progress is 2.00. VA benefits cannot be certified unless satisfactory progress standards are maintained. One hundred and eighty (180) credits are required to graduate with a baccalaureate degree (the total is greater in some programs). Grades of No Pass, withdrawals, Incomplete, X and audits do not count toward credits completed and may result in a VA over payment. Last Date of Attendance Reporting For reporting purposes, the last date of attendance is established using either 1) the actual date recorded in the registration system when a course is dropped or withdrawn from, or 2) by the 'last date attended' provided by instructors when X and NP grades are submitted. Reporting Changes in Your Enrollment Any changes to a student's schedule, including both adding and dropping courses, must be reported to the Veterans Certification Office immediately as these changes may have a direct effect on benefits paid by the VA. Immediate notification of these changes can prevent over payments and thus prevent future problems with the VA. Deployment Policy Any student with orders to report for active military duty may drop courses at any time during the term and receive a full refund. If sufficient course work has been accomplished and the instructor feels justified in granting credit for the course work completed, credit may be granted and no refund will be given. The Office of the Registrar will work with students on a case-by-case basis to determine the best course of action. Students called to active military duty generally have the following options: Full drop from all courses at any point during the term without academic or financial penalty, with full tuition and fee refund. Drop from some (but not all) courses at any point during the term without academic or financial penalty. Students who have completed a significant portion of their course work may be eligible to receive the grades earned in courses up to that point in time and/or request incomplete grades according to existing guidelines. Tuition would be refunded for withdrawn courses. Maintain registration in all courses. Students who have completed a significant portion of their course work may be eligible to receive the grades earned in courses up to that point in time and/or request incomplete grades according to existing guidelines. No tuition would be refunded. A determination on which option is best for the student will depend on the student's personal details, the time remaining in the term, the portion of coursework completed at the time of military activation, and the judgment of the instructors. Students called to active duty who want to drop courses or discuss other options, should bring a copy of their orders to the Veterans Certification Office, FMH Lobby and speak with a Veterans Certification Officer. Veterans Access Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 (38 U.S.C. 3679(c)) In compliance with the Veterans Access, Choice & Accountability Act of 2014, the following individuals shall be charged the in-state rate for tuition and fees purposes: A Veteran using educational assistance under either chapter 30 (Montgomery G.I. Bill(r) - Active Duty Program) or chapter 33 (Post-9/11 G.I. Bill(r)), of title 38, United States Code, who lives in the State of Oregon while attending a school located in the State of Oregon (regardless of his/her formal State of residence) and enrolls in the school within three years of discharge or release from a period of active duty service of 90 days or more. Anyone using transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill(r) benefits (38 U.S.C. SS 3319) who lives in the State of Oregon while attending a school located in the State of Oregon (regardless of his/her formal State of residence) and enrolls in the school within three years of the transferor's discharge or release from a period of active duty service of 90 days or more. Anyone using benefits under the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship (38 U.S.C. SS 3311(b)(9)) who lives in the State of Oregon while attending a school located in the State of Oregon (regardless of his/her formal State of residence) and enrolls in the school within three years of the Service member's death in the line of duty following a period of active duty service of 90 days or more. Anyone described above while he or she remains continuously enrolled (other than during regularly scheduled breaks between courses, semesters, or terms) at the same school. The person so described must have enrolled in the school prior to the expiration of the three year period following discharge, release, or death described above and must be using educational benefits under either chapter 30 or chapter 33, of title 38, United States Code.

More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. Missed Class Policy Purpose: This policy is to provide students who miss class or examinations a process to make up examinations or other graded in-class work, unless it can be shown that such an accommodation would compromise essential learning outcomes or constitute an unreasonable burden on the instructor. Rationale : Portland State University recognizes that students carry many responsibilities with them into the classroom, which may both enrich their educational experience and make it more challenging. These include university-sanctioned activities in which the student serves as a representative to the university such as student congress, athletics, drama, and academic meetings. Applicability: Students involved in university sanctioned or other legitimate activities, such as illness and family emergency. Activity program directors. Instructors of students who participate in university-sanctioned activities, including faculty, academic professionals, administrative staff, and teaching assistants. Policy: It is the responsibility of each instructor to determine and publish the class attendance policy in the course syllabus and distribute to the enrolled students at the beginning of the quarter. The instructor may approve absences at their discretion, in accordance with this policy. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor of absences due to university-sanctioned events or personal responsibilities in writing at the earliest possible opportunity. If a student must miss class due to an unforeseen event, the student must inform the instructor of the reason for the absence. Absences not cleared with an instructor before the specific class event (exam, presentation, assignment due) may require documentation/substantiation at the instructor's discretion. If the instructor decides that the absence is justifiable, then they should attempt to provide opportunities for equivalent work. When absences are approved beforehand by the student and instructor, the instructor will allow students to make up missed work and/or give an option to attain attendance points. When there is a dispute between students and instructors over the opportunity to make up work or attendances, the issue will be adjudicated by the chair of the department and then (only if needed) the dean of that school or theirr designee. The student may not place any undue burden on the instructor to provide opportunities to make up course work due to excused absences.

Non-degree/non-admit students A student may take a maximum of 8 credits in fall, winter and spring terms, and 21 in summer without applying for formal admission. A Non-Degree Entry form is used to create a student record and provide access to the registration system. There is a one time, nonrefundable fee. Non-degree students do not qualify for financial aid nor do they receive transfer credit evaluations. Non-degree students are allowed to preregister after admitted students. Students may apply online, or obtain a Non-Degree Entry form at www.pdx.edu/admissions/non-degree-applicant . Students who wish to take 9 or more credits in fall, winter, or spring terms must be formally admitted to the University. Students who plan to earn a degree at PSU should be admitted as soon as possible. Regardless of how many credits are earned while in non-degree status, there is no guarantee of admission. Formal admission is required to earn a degree.

Registration dates are determined by student class level and admissions status and are listed in the academic calendar under priority registration at www.pdx.edu/registration/academic-calendar . A current, detailed listing of term course offerings can be found in the online Class Schedule at www.sa.pdx.edu/soc . Detailed instructions for registration, priority registration dates, drop and add deadlines and academic calendar can be found online at www.pdx.edu/registration . The class schedule is available approximately eight weeks before the beginning of classes for winter and spring, and available in May for the following fall term. The academic calendar contains deadlines related to adding and dropping classes, making grade changes, withdrawing from classes, and refund percentages. These deadline dates are important as they determine the extent of financial obligation incurred by registration activity and they determine if and how a course registration will be recorded on a student's transcript. Students who withdraw or drop may be entitled to certain refunds of fees paid. See the Academic Calendar at www.pdx.edu/registration/academic-calendar . Non-attendance Students are responsible for dropping courses they do not wish to attend. Non-attendance does not cancel tuition charges, nor does it prevent the course and grade from appearing on the student's academic record. The University reserves the right to drop students who do not attend classes or do not have the proper prerequisites. Some academic departments administratively drop student who not not attend class on the first class meeting. If this happens, the student 1) remains responsible for any tuition charges associated with the registration, and 2) the course may be recorded permanently on the academic record, depending on when the department processes the drop. Students with mitigating circumstances who cannot attend class on the first day should notify the instructor or academic department as soon as possible to avoid being administratively dropped. Note: Students receiving state or federal aid who receive all X, M, NP, W, or F grades for a term whose attendance during that term cannot be verified, are subject to having all their funds returned.

Rationale : Portland State University recognizes that students carry many responsibilities with them into the classroom, which may both enrich their educational experience and make it more challenging. These include university-sanctioned activities in which the student serves as a representative to the university such as student congress, athletics, drama, and academic meetings. Applicability: Students involved in university sanctioned or other legitimate activities, such as illness and family emergency. Activity program directors. Instructors of students who participate in university-sanctioned activities, including faculty, academic professionals, administrative staff, and teaching assistants. Policy: It is the responsibility of each instructor to determine and publish the class attendance policy in the course syllabus and distribute to the enrolled students at the beginning of the quarter. The instructor may approve absences at their discretion, in accordance with this policy. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor of absences due to university-sanctioned events or personal responsibilities in writing at the earliest possible opportunity. If a student must miss class due to an unforeseen event, the student must inform the instructor of the reason for the absence. Absences not cleared with an instructor before the specific class event (exam, presentation, assignment due) may require documentation/substantiation at the instructor's discretion. If the instructor decides that the absence is justifiable, then they should attempt to provide opportunities for equivalent work. When absences are approved beforehand by the student and instructor, the instructor will allow students to make up missed work and/or give an option to attain attendance points. When there is a dispute between students and instructors over the opportunity to make up work or attendances, the issue will be adjudicated by the chair of the department and then (only if needed) the dean of that school or theirr designee. The student may not place any undue burden on the instructor to provide opportunities to make up course work due to excused absences.

The Veterans Administration requires that any veteran receiving GI Bill(r) benefits while attending PSU is required to obtain transcripts from all previously attended schools and submit them to the VA School Official for review for prior credit. Transcripts submitted from all previously attended schools to the Admission Office will be accessible to the VA School Official. It is not necessary to submit two copies. Each term, after registration, veteran students intending to use their education benefits must submit the Online Veterans Certification form. Course adds, drops, withdrawals, class cancellations and changes of program made after submitting the veterans certification form must be reported as soon as possible to the Veterans Certification Office, FMH Lobby. GI Bill(r) is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. Academic Credit for Military Training After admission, credit may be granted for some types of military service courses on the college level where equivalency to Portland State courses can be shown, as informed by the ACE recommendations. Veterans should provide transcripts from appropriate military schools and a copy of VA form DD214 to the Veterans Certification unit of the Office of the Registrar upon application to PSU. Veteran Priority Registration Portland State University offers early, priority registration to students using veterans' educational benefits and to veterans and military members who submit appropriate documentation. Priority registration supports timely program completion in compliance with Oregon House Bill 2565. Students being certified by the Registrar's Office for federal VA educational benefits will automatically be given veteran priority registration. Other veteran and military members can submit a copy of the DD-214 issued under honorable or general conditions to show proof of service in order to be enrolled in veteran priority registration. Submit DD214 to o the Veteran Certification Office in the FMH Lobby or to vetcert@pdx.edu. Satisfactory Progress Standards In order to maintain satisfactory progress, the student veteran must complete the following credits: Certified for: Undergraduate: Graduate: Full time 12+ credits 9+ credits Three-quarter time 9 - 11 credits 7 - 8 credits One-half time 6 - 8 credits 5 - 6 credits The cumulative GPA at Portland State University required to maintain satisfactory progress is 2.00. VA benefits cannot be certified unless satisfactory progress standards are maintained. One hundred and eighty (180) credits are required to graduate with a baccalaureate degree (the total is greater in some programs). Grades of No Pass, withdrawals, Incomplete, X and audits do not count toward credits completed and may result in a VA over payment. Last Date of Attendance Reporting For reporting purposes, the last date of attendance is established using either 1) the actual date recorded in the registration system when a course is dropped or withdrawn from, or 2) by the 'last date attended' provided by instructors when X and NP grades are submitted. Reporting Changes in Your Enrollment Any changes to a student's schedule, including both adding and dropping courses, must be reported to the Veterans Certification Office immediately as these changes may have a direct effect on benefits paid by the VA. Immediate notification of these changes can prevent over payments and thus prevent future problems with the VA. Deployment Policy Any student with orders to report for active military duty may drop courses at any time during the term and receive a full refund. If sufficient course work has been accomplished and the instructor feels justified in granting credit for the course work completed, credit may be granted and no refund will be given. The Office of the Registrar will work with students on a case-by-case basis to determine the best course of action. Students called to active military duty generally have the following options: Full drop from all courses at any point during the term without academic or financial penalty, with full tuition and fee refund. Drop from some (but not all) courses at any point during the term without academic or financial penalty. Students who have completed a significant portion of their course work may be eligible to receive the grades earned in courses up to that point in time and/or request incomplete grades according to existing guidelines. Tuition would be refunded for withdrawn courses. Maintain registration in all courses. Students who have completed a significant portion of their course work may be eligible to receive the grades earned in courses up to that point in time and/or request incomplete grades according to existing guidelines. No tuition would be refunded. A determination on which option is best for the student will depend on the student's personal details, the time remaining in the term, the portion of coursework completed at the time of military activation, and the judgment of the instructors. Students called to active duty who want to drop courses or discuss other options, should bring a copy of their orders to the Veterans Certification Office, FMH Lobby and speak with a Veterans Certification Officer. Veterans Access Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 (38 U.S.C. 3679(c)) In compliance with the Veterans Access, Choice & Accountability Act of 2014, the following individuals shall be charged the in-state rate for tuition and fees purposes: A Veteran using educational assistance under either chapter 30 (Montgomery G.I.

The undergraduate program seeks to educate students about the causes, consequences, prevention, and control of criminal and law-violating activity at multiple levels of analysis. Our undergraduate curriculum focuses on (1) criminology and criminal justice theories and empirical research addressing the role of individuals, families, communities, and society in the production and prevention of crime, (2) the justice system's function in controlling crime, and (3) a critical analysis of the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of related policies and practices. Educational experiences facilitated inside and outside of class help promote students' long term professional success by developing their capacity for critical reasoning, problem-solving, and effective communication. Criminology & Criminal Justice is an interdisciplinary major, a fact demonstrated by the diverse backgrounds of our full-time and part-time faculty. Students graduating from our program have a wide range of choices when they look for employment or post-graduate education. Recent graduates have found jobs in law enforcement (e.g., police officer, immigration, crime analyst), courts (e.g., victim advocate, administration), corrections (e.g., parole officer, facility management), human services (e.g., offender counseling, child welfare), and crime prevention (e.g., neighborhood crime prevention specialist, private security). Other alumni from our program have gone on to pursue advanced degrees in such areas as law, criminal justice, psychology, social work, public administration, and urban planning.

Mathematics M.A./M.S. Statistics M.S. M.S. in Mathematics for Teachers Mathematical Sciences Ph.D. Mathematics Education Ph.D. Applied Statistics Graduate Certificate Applied Statistics Graduate Certificate The Graduate Certificate Program in Applied Statistics (GCAS) is primarily designed to provide a companion credential for students in other graduate programs (including Mathematics) who have demonstrated expertise in methods and techniques for the quantitative analysis and modeling of data. Graduate programs that share a common interest in the application of statistical methods to the analysis of data and the solutions of problems include: Psychology, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Economics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Engineering and Technology Management, Environmental Sciences and Resources, Mechanical Engineering, Political Sciences, Sociology, Urban Studies, Systems Science. However, the GCAS program equally serves those who want to pursue just the graduate certificate. Admission: Program prerequisites: Prospective students must have a basic preparation in mathematics and statistics and in a particular disciplinary field that would allow for advanced work in statistical methods as well as applications in one or more content areas. This preparation must be demonstrated by the completion of calculus-based courses in probability and distribution theory. A background in basic statistical methodology is assumed. Prerequisites for the GCAS are: 3 terms of Calculus ( Mth 251 -253), Linear Algebra ( Mth 261 ), and a statistical methods course ( Stat 452 /552 or Stat 244 ). As the sequence Stat 551 , Stat 552 is a prerequisite, it is not applicable toward program requirements. In addition to the program prerequisites, applicants must meet the university's minimum admission requirements including English language proficiency . This program currently offers rolling admissions. Instructions on how to apply: if you are not already enrolled in a graduate degree program at Portland State University, see this page for admission instructions: https://www.pdx.edu/math/graduate-application-instructions . If you are currently a graduate student and wish to add the certificate to your program, please submit a GO-19 Request for Change of Major form . The form must be signed by your current department's Chair before submitting it to the Mathematics and Statistics department. Program Goals, Objectives: Many graduate programs include a research methods component that requires the student to acquire some exposure to statistical methods as the basis for the design of experiments and analysis of data. The Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics (GCAS) goes well beyond those requirements -- the student develops both a depth of understanding of methods and a breadth of application across disciplines. It is expected that a student who earns this certificate would be capable of performing sophisticated statistical analysis and modeling for problems within his or her particular discipline. They would also be expected to be able to access and understand consultation with professional statisticians and provide consultation in the application of statistical methods for research purposes and in the solution of practical problems. The goal of the GCAS program is a coordinated plan for which students will be assured of exposure to statistical techniques needed in most applications. Core Requirements: This Graduate Certificate credential may be completed with a minimum of 24 credit hours of statistical graduate coursework with no comprehensive exam, while the MS in Statistics requires more extensive coursework and examinations. Graduate certificate students must have a minimum 3.00 GPA on all courses applied to the program of study, as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in all graduate-level courses taken at PSU. Although grades of C+, C, and C- are below the graduate standard, they may be counted as credit toward a graduate certificate with the specific written approval of the program. Students are responsible for knowing University-level graduate policies and procedures for obtaining the certificate. These policies and procedures are in the Graduate School section of the PSU Bulletin. Several of the most frequently asked questions about University-level graduate policies and procedures can also be found on the Graduate School website . Course of Study The program of study leading to a GCAS requires the successful completion of a minimum of 24 graduate credit hours of coursework distributed as three components: Applied statistics core sequence : The goal of this sequence is to introduce students to fundamentals of applied statistics. The three-term core course sequence: Stat 564 Applied Regression Analysis (3 credits) and Stat 565 , Stat 566 Experimental Design: Theory and Methods I, II, (3 credits each) Additional applied statistics courses : The objective is developing a breadth of knowledge in the application of statistical methods within the discipline and in related areas. A minimum of 12 additional hours chosen from the list of interdisciplinary courses below. Please note that 510/610 courses and Stat 551 , Stat 552 are not acceptable toward the certificate. Statistical consulting : To provide experience in dealing with real statistical problems Stat 570 Statistical Consulting (3 credits). Please note that this course is only offered during spring term. All courses applied to the certificate program must have a B- or better grade. To continue in the program, students are required to maintain regular graduate student status, requiring a cumulative 3.00 GPA for all coursework and a term GPA of at least 2.67.

Its fields include metaphysics (ultimate nature of reality), epistemology (nature of knowledge and reasoning), and ethics (principles of moral obligation). Through the study of the Philosophy Department's curriculum, students learn about the historical traditions and contemporary theories in these fields. Philosophy also examines the basic concepts, principles, and arguments of the major scientific and intellectual disciplines concerned with the study of domains of reality, features and practices of knowledge, and social values and arrangements. These topics are addressed in areas such as philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion. The study of philosophy enriches students' lives as metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical reflection is essential to individual development and cultures across time and place. Moreover, philosophy enhances skills of abstract thinking, clear argumentative writing, careful reading and analysis of texts, and oral argument. Philosophical training is then valuable in almost any area of life and any occupation that requires examination and analysis of problems, critical evaluation of alternative solutions, and rational advocacy of conclusions and courses of action. Philosophy is also an excellent undergraduate major for pre-professional students: philosophy majors outscore all other majors on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE's) and receive scores among the highest on the LSAT's, GMAT's, and MCAT's. It is ideal for those who aspire to work in the legal profession and fitting for students planning careers in medicine. And finally, as the quintessential interdisciplinary course of study, philosophy is a wonderful second-major and compliments the course of study in the physical and social sciences, arts, and humanities.

The MA is increasingly the degree expected for teachers both in the United States and abroad, where it is generally a requirement for university-level teaching. Admission Requirements Admission to graduate study at Portland State University. Admission to the MA TESOL program. See the department website for application information (www.pdx.edu/applied-linguistics) . Proficiency in English. If the student is not a native speaker of English and doesn't hold a valid B.A. degree or equivalent from an English-medium university, a minimum TOEFL iBT score of 100, IELTS 7.0, or Pearson Test of English (PTE) score of 68 is required for admission. The M.A. TESOL program does not accept the DuoLingo English Test for evidence of proficiency. Alternatively, students can be admitted after completing Portland State's Intensive English Language Program (IELP) with a GPA of 3.5 and receiving a recommendation for graduate study from the IELP. Persons interested in applying for the MA TESOL Program should write to the Department of Applied Linguistics at linginfo@pdx.edu or visit the department's website at www.pdx.edu/applied-linguistics for additional information. Regular information sessions are held for prospective students. Contact the department for details. Degree Requirements Students must meet with an adviser regularly, starting in the first term of the program. In addition to the minimum graduate school requirements, students must have an adviser-approved program that meets the criteria below. (For those students who have completed the Certificate in TESL, adviser-approved courses will be used to substitute for some of the following requirements.) Each student will complete a total of 48-50 credits: 20 credits of required courses, 24 credits of additional coursework from one of the three tracks listed below, and 4-6 credits of culminating experience. The three tracks are: (1) MA TESOL - Standard Track, (2) MA TESOL - Language Assessment Not Required, (3) MA TESOL with focus in Applied Linguistics. Based on their professional goals and previous experience, and in consultation with their adviser, students choose one of the three tracks. For all tracks, students must complete either a four-credit Culminating Workshop course ( Ling 566 ), in which they prepare their professional portfolio based on work throughout their MA, or a six-credit Thesis ( Ling 503 ).

Our programs are grounded in the theory and values of community development: the process of collective mobilization for social, economic, and racial justice--often at the neighborhood level. Graduates of our programs are knowledgeable about housing, community organizing, transportation, economic development, and environmental issues. The programs provide excellent preparation for working in non-profit organizations, consulting firms, and public agencies. Common graduate school pathways include urban planning, public policy, public administration, public health, social work, and social sciences.

Degree Maps and Learning Outcomes Admission requirements Community Development B.A./B.S Community Development Minor Real Estate Development Minor Sustainable Urban Development Minor Community Development B.A./B.S. The Community Development major is one of just 16 such programs nationwide, and the only one of these whose campus is located in a city's Central Business District. According to the International Association for Community Development, CD is a \"practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes participative democracy, sustainable development, rights, economic opportunity, equality and social justice, through the organization, education and empowerment of people within their communities, whether these be of locality, identity or interest, in urban and rural settings.\" PSU's curriculum is grounded in applied social science and incorporates a great deal of community-based learning. The program takes advantage of the wealth of resources available in the Portland metropolitan area and draws from a variety of academic disciplines. We aim to equip our students as community activists, applying their analytical and interpersonal skills to catalyze transformative social change. Our alumni are found in community-based organizations, think tanks, City of Portland, Portland Housing Bureau, Metro (regional government), state and local transportation agencies, and community-oriented financial institutions, and beyond. For more information about careers, see the Career Center's \"What can I do with a degree in Community Development?\" at https://www.pdx.edu/careers/what-can-i-do-degree-community-development . To reach the CD major coordinator, contact CDmajor@pdx.edu. Degree Requirements In addition to the general university degree requirements, students in the Community Development major must complete 58 credits of coursework comprising 46 credits of required courses and 12 credits of electives. Some of these courses have prerequisites and some are only offered once a year, so students should plan their program carefully in collaboration with their academic advisor. In particular, the field experience requires independent advance planning. Substitution of coursework is acceptable only by permission from the CD major coordinator; consult with your academic advisor before pursuing a course substitution. Major Requirements Core courses (12 credits) The core introduces students to the social, political, cultural, and economic aspects of urban life as well as the practice of community development. USP 300U Introduction to Urban Studies 4 USP 301U Introduction to Community Development 4 USP 432 Theory and Philosophy of Community Development 4 Areas of community development (12 credits) The \"areas\" courses take an interdisciplinary approach to major themes in community development. USP 312U Urban Housing and Development 4 USP 313U Urban Environmental Issues 4 USP 316 Community Organizing and Social Change 4 Methods (16 credits) Methods courses teach practical skills for doing community development work in the real world. They address technical skills--such as mapping and data analysis, interpersonal skills, and ethical community practice. USP 350U Inclusive Engagement 4 USP 430 Participatory Research Methods for Community Development 4 USP 440 Critical Analysis of Community Data 4 USP 452 GIS for Community Development 4 Field Experience (6 credits) An essential part of the major is pursuing personal interests and gaining experience in the practice of community development. Students identify a professional development opportunity--generally in partnership with community organization--where they can apply the skills they have learned in the major by participating in community capacity-building efforts. This experience should be completed near the end of a student's academic program and the placement must be approved in advance. While completing 120+ hours of \"field\" work, students enroll in USP 460 Community Development Field Seminar. This course serves as a community of practice for emerging CD professionals. The seminar is a variable-credit course because students may complete their field experience in one term (6 credits of seminar) or spread it across multiple consecutive terms in one academic year (for example, take the seminar for two credits in fall, winter, and spring). See the field experience resource site for more information about the process: https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/cdfieldexperience/home . USP 460 Community Development Field Seminar 2-6 Electives (12 credits) Students must take 12 credits of electives, with at least 8 of these credits from courses in the School of Urban Studies and Planning (USP prefix). Any regularly offered USP course that is 300-level or higher can be used as an elective. Using by-arrangement and additional field experience credits would need to be approved in advance by the CD major coordinator; consult with your academic advisor. The department also maintains a list of courses from around the university that can be used as electives. Consult with your academic advisor or the CD major coordinator about this list, or if you are interested in another non-USP course that aligns with the major's student learning outcomes. The CD program encourages students to participate in study abroad and other intercultural experiences. Advising The academic advisors in the Urban, Public, and Global Affairs Pathway work with CD majors and students in other programs in the College of Urban and Public Affairs to plan their overall academic program; students should meet with their advisor regularly to make sure they understand all their degree requirements. Students who have already completed coursework in the major before Fall 2013 should be aware that the curriculum has changed. The academic advisor and CD major coordinator and the academic advisor can assist with aligning the old and new courses. The CD major coordinator oversees the CD major and has expertise in community development and related fields, including the course offerings within the School of Urban Studies and Planning (USP); contact the coordinator at CDmajor@pdx.edu . Building relationships with the major coordinator and other USP faculty members is a valuable way to get advising and mentoring in the areas of community development, urban planning, and allied fields from nationally recognized experts. Attending USP events and introducing yourself to faculty members during office hours are great ways to get started.", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2023-2024/bulletin/college-of-urban-and-public-affairs/nohad-a-toulan-school-of-urban-studies-and-planning/undergraduate-programs/community-development-b-a-b-s", "title": "\r\n\tPortland State University\u00a0-\u00a0Community Development B.A./B.S.\r\n", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Applied Linguistics Minor Requirements To earn a minor in applied linguistics a student must have a major in another department and must complete 28 adviser-approved credits (at least 24 credits of which must be taken in residence at PSU), to include the following: Courses 28 credits Ling 390 Introduction to Linguistics 4 Linguistics electives 24 All linguistics electives require prior approval by the departmental undergraduate adviser.

Courses are taught in areas such as editing, design, online documentation, and information technology. The program has rolling admissions which follow the University's admission deadlines as follows: April 1st for Fall admission; Sept. 1st for Winter; and Nov. 1st for Spring. Please note that Graduate Assistantship applications can only be accepted from fall term applicants, who must meet the April 1 deadline. Book Publishing also awards Graduate Assistantships in the second year of the program for one year only; the deadlines for application will be announced within the program annually, and receiving such an appointment is conditional on the appointee remaining for the entire coming school year. Admission Requirements Admission to graduate study is granted on the basis of evidence of suitable preparation and the probability of success in the intended field of study; strong writing skills are considered central. Applicants do not need to have a previous degree in English or Writing, but must hold a B.A. or B.S. degree from a regionally accredited college or university. Applicants must also submit the following: A letter of introduction. A complete set of transcripts. A transcript from each post-secondary institution you have attended is required. Unofficial transcripts or photocopies are acceptable. You will be asked to upload a transcript for each institution in one of the following supported file types: PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, or TIF. A minimum of three letters of recommendation. A writing sample of fifteen to thirty pages of writing that demonstrates your potential as a publishing professional. Previously published work is welcome, and your sample can consist of multiple pieces, so long as they do not exceed the page limit. Your sample can be of a professional, academic, or artistic nature (or a mixture of the three). Indeed, a diversity of materials is often most effective at demonstrating your strengths as a prospective student for the graduate program in Book Publishing. If you have editing or design experience, samples of this work are welcome, but in these instances, please be sure to include a brief cover letter that details your role in these projects. With editing samples, it's particularly important that we can actually see the editing you've done; one way to achieve this is to submit both pre- and post-editing versions, another is to submit a document with your copyediting marks handwritten on it, and yet another is to submit a document with track changes. You will be asked to upload your writing samples and optional material such as a C.V. or resume in one of the following supported file types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, RTF, or TXT. Note: Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are not required for admission. Requirements Students will complete 24 core credits (6 courses), 12 elective credits (3 courses) in writing, and 12 elective credits (3 courses) that may involve coursework in another discipline with Adviser's approval. Of the 24 elective credits, candidates are expected to take a total of eight (8) credits working at Ooligan Press in either or both Wr 574 Publishing Studio or Wr 575 Publishing Lab. The final project, in addition to completing the coursework, will be a portfolio of work demonstrating competence at a professional level, but with adviser approval, may be a single, substantive work. Upon completion and delivery of the final project or portfolio to the student's orals committee, a topic will be assigned by the student's adviser for a final paper of approximately 4000 words (excluding front matter and back matter). The student will take an oral exam in defense of the final project and final paper. Work included in a portfolio will be representative of that done in each course, and appropriate to it, but may otherwise focus in greater detail on one or more areas of study. For instance, the portfolio may include samples of editorial work, query letters for fiction and nonfiction books, book marketing plans, book design proposals and finished designs, research and writing on issues in contemporary publishing. Other possibilities are negotiable with the assigned graduate adviser in Book Publishing. Core Courses (24 credits) Students choose 6 out of 7 available core courses to satisfy the 24-credit requirement.

The study of history contributes to the goals of a liberal arts education by enabling students to gain a deep appreciation of the diversity of human experience over time. Through the study of history, students learn how to interpret their own experience and to shape their own values by engaging in dialogues with the past. The study of history also nurtures the ability to view the world from multiple perspectives, including interdisciplinary ones. Finally, history provides the foundation for informed participation in both the local and the global community by teaching how to apply critical thinking skills to solving problems. The study of history offers excellent training for a variety of occupations, from teaching to law, government, business, and the arts. The Department of History encourages active engagement in historical inquiry, whether at the introductory survey level, in seminars, or in community-based learning. Active engagement requires students to learn how to master basic knowledge, ask historical questions, access and evaluate information, and communicate what they have learned in both written and oral forms. Helping students master the use of a variety of sources and tools to unlock the past is a goal of all history courses. The combined expertise of faculty in the Department of History encompasses a diversity of fields ranging from Oregon and the Pacific Northwest to World History. The department offers lower-division surveys in World History and U.S. history, but the gateway course for the major is Hst 300 Historical Imagination, which provides an introduction to the discipline--both the theory and practice--of history. Upper-division offerings include a wide range of subject areas, from the Ancient Near East to American Family History. Reading seminars (Hst 491) and research seminars (Hst 492) on specialized topics--such as medieval Spain or Japanese nationalism--provide the opportunity for majors to write a substantial research paper and to participate in intensive reading and discussion of topics. Hst 490 Comparative World History--a thematic course--is required for the major to ensure that students develop the ability to frame what they know in a world historical context and to apply comparative analysis to important historical topics. Advising is critical, because majors are encouraged to develop their own thematic, chronological, or geographical focus through their choice of upper-division elective courses. In line with the University's mission as an urban, public institution, the Department of History supports internships and partnerships with the Oregon Historical Society and other local and regional museums, archives, and historical societies and offers training in public history. All faculty consider both teaching and research, along with community service, to be part of their responsibilities as members of the Department of History. The creation of knowledge, as well as its dissemination through teaching and publication, is a vital part of the department's mission.

This program provides a balance between mathematics and mathematics education in order to develop mathematics educators who can become: (i) Faculty members in mathematics departments or schools of education in universities, four year colleges, or community colleges; (ii) Curriculum specialists in mathematics, supervisors of mathematics at the middle school level or secondary school level, or mathematics specialists in state or local departments of education; (iii) Private sector specialists in mathematics education. Admission: Program prerequisites: Candidates in this program must currently have (or complete during their program) a master's degree in mathematics equivalent to the MA/MS in Mathematics degree or the MS-MTCH degree at Portland State University. In addition to program prerequisites, applicants must meet the university's minimum admission requirements including English language proficiency . This program admits once per year for fall term only. See instructions on how to apply: https://www.pdx.edu/math/graduate-application-instructions Degree requirements Students are responsible for knowing University-level graduate policies and procedures for obtaining the degree. These policies and procedures are in the Graduate School section of the PSU Bulletin . Several of the most frequently asked questions about University-level graduate policies and procedures can also be found on the Graduate School website . Candidates must complete an approved program of 84 credit hours consisting of three major components: coursework, a research practicum experience, and dissertation research. Coursework must include a minimum of: 18 credit hours in Mathematics Education Research Courses ( Mth 690 -695); 18 credit hours of other 500-600 level mathematics courses; and 18 hours of graduate coursework in supporting areas outside of mathematics (such as curriculum and instruction, psychology, educational policy, science, computer science, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, etc.) Research Practicum Mth 601 (3 credits) The purpose of the research experience will be to provide candidates with an opportunity to use methodological techniques in mathematics education early on in their course of study. Prior to the dissertation, candidates will be expected to gain experience with the qualitative and quantitative approaches that are now used by many researchers and curriculum developers in mathematics education. Some examples of possible research practicum experiences are: case studies of students' learning documented over time, studies of teachers' practice in the mathematics classroom, documentation of teachers' beliefs about mathematics as they implement new curricula. Dissertation Research Mth 603 (27 credits) The Ph.D. dissertation research will ordinarily be conducted under the guidance of a mathematics educator in the Fariborz Maseeh Department of Mathematics and Statistics. The dissertation is the most important part of a candidate's program, and involves identifying and researching a significant problem which builds upon previous research, and which will make an original contribution to an area of research in mathematics education. Dissertation committees consisting of a mix of faculty with expertise in mathematics education, mathematics, curriculum and instruction, and other areas outside of mathematics education will be encouraged. After completing the comprehensive examinations, the chairperson and dissertation committee will be appointed. The student will develop a dissertation proposal which will be defended in an oral presentation to the committee. When the proposal has been approved by the committee, and if necessary by the University Human Subjects Research Review committee, the student will be considered a candidate for the Ph.D. in mathematics education. The dissertation must be completed according to the outlines of the proposal approved by the candidate's committee. Students must register for dissertation credit during each term they are engaged in dissertation research. Upon completion of doctoral thesis work, the candidate will defend the dissertation before the committee in an oral presentation that is open to other interested faculty and students. The student is expected to demonstrate knowledge of the research literature in mathematics education that relates to the particular problem chosen for research, and to show how the dissertation contributes to work in this area. Demonstrated competency areas: Prior to completing their program, candidates in the Mathematics Education Ph.D. program will be expected to demonstrate competency in the following 7 areas: mathematics education mathematics supporting content areas teaching the use of technology in teaching mathematics the application of mathematics education in an urban setting research in mathematics education 1.

Managing R&D projects, technological systems, technical organizations and resources, and other professionals requires management knowledge and skills. Engineers and scientists are faced with these challenges very early in their careers. Typically, within three to seven years after graduation, they find themselves addressing complex issues which necessitate that they play two roles simultaneously: the role of the specialist and the manager of technology. Those who choose the management path start moving toward management responsibilities while maintaining identity in their technical backgrounds - the Department of Engineering and Technology Management (ETM) has been designed for them. The Department of Engineering and Technology Management addresses the needs of engineers and scientists whose objective is to advance to technical management positions in business, industry, or government. We also address the needs of those wishing to continue their engineering/technology management research-based studies while pursuing careers at either academic institutions or R&D organizations. ETM draws on the strengths of the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science, the School of Business Administration, and several other relevant academic disciplines. By utilizing the diverse faculty resources of Portland State University, the program offers the opportunity to study the human, technical, and analytical aspects of management. Most of the courses in the program are offered during the evening hours to fit the schedule of practicing professionals. Admission requirements Engineering and Technology Management M.S.

Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies advisers work closely with each student to craft a course of study appropriate to the student's academic interests and post-graduate goals. An expanding field of scholarship, women, gender, and sexuality studies is on the cutting edge of educational and intellectual innovation. The department offers two different majors: the Women's Studies major, and the Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies major. The Women's Studies major encourages students to develop critical thinking skills and an appreciation for the range of theoretical frameworks and methodologies present in contemporary feminist scholarship. Courses incorporate the diversity of women's experience with attention to race, class, and sexual orientation as well as gender. Core courses also encourage students' active participation through discussion, informal as well as formal writing, and collaborative learning in the classroom. The major in Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies (SGQS) is designed to provide an in-depth study of sexual desire, sexual behavior and identity, gendered behavior, gender identity, and the sexed body as socially, culturally, and historically produced. The core curriculum emphasizes queer and trans of color theorizing and critiques including queer indigenous, Two-Spirit, and transnational perspectives; critical analysis of the relationships between sexuality and other power formations such as gender, race, class, nation, ability, nature, citizenship, age, and size; historical contexts and contemporary connections among rigorous theoretical, activist, political, and practice-oriented approaches; and an interdisciplinary, queer, and decolonial approach to analyses of the creative arts, humanities, and health and social sciences. Experiential learning plays an important role in a student's progress through the women, gender, and sexuality studies curriculum. The program's extensive and long-established ties with organizations in the Metro area provide wide-ranging opportunities for students to apply their classroom knowledge in a community setting. Many students discover a life's vocation through these experiences, and all develop new skills. Guidelines for women, gender, and sexuality studies practica and independent study are flexible in order to meet individual needs. Degrees in Women's Studies and Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies provide the foundations for life-long learning as well as background and experience for careers in teaching, counseling and social work, business, law, health sciences, public administration, public relations, and academia.

The Healthcare MBA M.S. in Finance (MSF) Global Supply Chain Management Master of Science (MSGSCM) M.S. in Real Estate Taxation Master of (MT) Master of Business Administration (MBA) The MBA is an integrated graduate program focused on broad business knowledge based on values of sustainability and stakeholder focus. Students master essential technical skills through the Value Chain of Business courses gain in-depth understanding of the broad context of business in the Foundations of Competitiveness courses, and begin to develop leadership skills and perspectives through the Leadership Foundations courses. In addition, students will specialize in either Applied Skills (designed for full-time students) or Advanced Leadership (designed for part-time students) courses. A highlight of the MBA program is the International Experience, which requires that all MBA students participate in either a 10-14 day study abroad program or a Portland Metro-based business experience during their MBA experience. The MBA is designed to accommodate students with business and non-business undergraduate degrees and is best suited for those who have gained at least two years of industry experience prior to their admission date--although early career students are accepted into the full-time cohort based on academic success in undergraduate studies and readiness for a graduate business experience. Students may elect to complete the MBA program in either the full-time or part-time evening format. Students are expected to progress through the program with their assigned cohort and follow the schedule of core courses. Both full-time and part-time students are required to complete 54 required (core) credits plus a minimum of 6 credits of electives. Elective courses and certificate classes are primarily offered during the evenings or online. The goal of the MBA program is to develop skilled managers and highly effective leaders. This program seeks to produce future business leaders with a commitment to social, economic and environmental stewardship. The core coursework in the MBA program is grouped into three segments for a total of 54 credits: Foundations of Competitiveness, The Value Chain of Business, and Leadership Foundations. In addition, students will complete a minimum of 6 additional elective credits from one of the following pillars: Applied Skills: This pillar is designed primarily for students in the full-time cohort, although part-time students can opt to follow one of the Applied Skills Pathways. Advanced Leadership: This pillar is designed exclusively for students in the part-time cohort. All students will complete the MBA Capstone as their culminating experience.

The primary goal of the IE is to provide a first-hand experience of the opportunities and challenges of competing in a global marketplace. The IE is also designed to enhance cultural knowledge and build additional leadership competency. The IE requires either a 10- to 14-day immersion in a foreign country ( BA 526 ) or a locally-based domestic business experience ( BA 527 ) which may be available to students who petition for an approved exception to the international travel requirement. Students who complete the domestic experience must complete an additional 3 credits of electives in order to meet the program requirements. Students must complete at least their first year of the MBA core curriculum before participating in the IE or the domestic business experience. Waiver Policy Students may be eligible for waiver of some required courses in the MBA program. A waiver is based upon the student holding an undergraduate degree (earned within the previous seven years), an active license in the specific discipline for which the waiver is sought, or in the case of BTA 519 a Graduate Certificate in HR Analytics or Business Intelligence and Analytics. Specifically, the following courses may be considered for waiver: Actg 511 , Actg 513 , Fin 515 , Fin 516 , Fin 517 , ISQA 511 , BTA 519 and Mgmt 512 .

Sociologists examine groups of as small as two or as large as billions. From the smallest friendship or family group to the great global web of human activity, sociologists analyze and interpret our world. Sociologists use many theoretical approaches, data, and research techniques. Information comes from many sources including surveys, historical documents, census data, intensive interviews, and participant observation. This information is analyzed and used to explain phenomena such as power relations, beliefs and value systems, organizations, and the larger structure of society. Sociology provides valuable tools for thought and a strong foundation for careers in many fields including education, business, journalism, government, and social service. A major in sociology also prepares students for graduate programs leading to careers in research, public service, and higher education.

Field Geology (4 credits) G 581 Field Geology 4 Internship or Project (4-8 credits) a. One to two terms of internship or project (4-8 credits). b. At the beginning of the internship the student must meet with their employer or internship/project adviser to outline internship responsibilities and identify 2 to 3 major milestones. At the halfway point of the internship the student will complete a self-assessment based on the agreed upon milestones. At this time the internship/project adviser will complete a progress report to the PSU PSM faculty. c. For a two-term internship or project, a second self-assessment and internship/project adviser progress report is required by the end of the first term. d. An end of internship or project product is determined by employer or internship/project adviser (i.e. report, presentation). e. The student's internship/project adviser will provide a final evaluation of the student's internship/project experience. f. The PSU PSM faculty committee will complete a pass/no pass assessment based upon the following: 1) Original internship responsibilities and milestones, 2) Mid-internship student self-assessment and internship/project adviser progress report. 3) End of internship product, 4) Final evaluation of the student's internship/project experience by the internship/project adviser. g. Students must register for G 504 during the same term(s) as the time the internship is done. Additional Details for the Experiential Component Internship or Project (4-8 credits): Students may complete either an 8 credit internship (equivalent to either two terms of 4 credit hours/week internship experience, or an accelerated 8 credit hours/week internship experience in one term), or students may complete a 4 credit internship (equivalent to one term of 4 credit hours/week internship experience), or students may complete two separate 4 credit internships with an 8 credit total. The faculty also encourage students with unique internship opportunities such as rapid hazard response (e.g. landslide, debris flow, fire, earthquake, tsunami, volcanic events) to arrange to enroll in the appropriate average weekly credit hours for the term. Rapid response to geologic hazards will require different time allocation in the days and weeks after an event, as a result the internship could be a concentrated effort in a period of weeks instead of over a full quarter. The internship project adviser and the PSU PSM faculty committee will advise the student on the average weekly credit hours for a rapid response hazards internship opportunity. Students employed as professional geologists may complete the internship component with their current employer, however the student must engage in new technical experiential activities and take on new responsibilities that meet guidelines for fulfillment of the internship. When an internship begins the student must meet with their employer or internship/project adviser to outline the responsibilities of the intern, identify 2 to 3 major milestones to gauge the intern's progress. PSU PSM faculty will review and sign off on the outlined internship expectations. At the half-way mark the student will review agreed upon milestones and provide a self-assessment with a short explanation of progress toward those milestones. The internship adviser will review this self-assessment document and complete a progress report for the PSU PSM faculty. Both the self-assessment and the progress report will be reviewed by the PSU PSM faculty to gauge satisfactory progress. For a two-term internship or project, a second self-assessment and internship/project adviser progress report is required by the end of the first term. See details provided in part b. above. An end of internship product includes either a report or presentation. Presentations may be held at the internship granting agency, or at the Department of Geology at PSU. PSU PSM faculty will attend either in person or remotely, arrangements will be made by the student in coordination with the internship adviser and PSU PSM faculty. At the conclusion of an internship products will be made publicly available as either recorded presentations and/or reports. The student's internship/project adviser will provide a final evaluation of the student's internship/project experience. The adviser may reach out directly to the PSU PSM faculty at any point during the internship to communicate about the student's performance, or changes to the direction of the internship milestones and anticipated deliverables. Field Geology (4 credits): G 581 may be replaced with an equivalent graduate level field course from another institution pending faculty approval. For this approval the student must provide the faculty with the following information: 1) A paragraph describing the proposed course replacement including the type of work to be completed in the proposed field, an explanation of why this replacement is necessary (e.g. time & logistics, or the field course offers a section in the student's sub-discipline). 2) The graduate field course description for the other institution, and the web-address for this description. 3) A web address, flyer or email from the other institution that demonstrates suitable content covered in the course.

Every student is encouraged to take one credit of Comm 507 (Communication Research Apprenticeship) per quarter (a maximum of 6 credits may be counted toward the requirements of the degree). Comm 507 involves working closely with a faculty member in order to gain hands-on experience in how to conduct communication research. All students need at least 40 credits in graduate coursework, including the core requirements, electives and apprenticeship courses. In addition, all students need at least 6 credits of Thesis or Project, bringing the total number of credits to 46. Program options All students complete one of the following with close supervision of their advisor. We strongly encourage students to pursue the thesis option. a. Thesis The thesis entails a systematic study of a significant problem and contributes to the body of knowledge relevant to the study. A thesis is a research report completed in close consultation with the student's academic advisor and may be either quantitative or qualitative. Each student who elects the thesis option will complete a written thesis and pass a final oral examination. Prior to beginning work on the thesis, students must demonstrate proficiency in relevant theories and research methods. Students must complete at least 6 thesis credits ( Comm 503 ). b. Project Students who choose the Project Option work closely with their faculty advisor on planning a course of study grounded in relevant theories, concepts and practices. All students who choose this option must demonstrate appropriate research and methodological competency by successfully completing 3 exams as the culminating project.

With a relatively small knowledge of atoms and molecules, it is possible to have a considerable understanding of many chemical phenomena we see and use. A comprehensive knowledge of chemistry is essential for the person who wishes to help solve the problems of today--problems of illness and disease, problems of wise use of our resources--and for the person who wants to do basic research in chemistry or who wants to work in the chemical industry. The Department of Chemistry is committed to maintaining a teaching program of excellence at the undergraduate level as well as having a graduate program emphasizing cutting-edge research in the chemistry of the environment, novel materials and biological systems. Courses tailored for the student desiring only an introduction to the field are offered on a regular basis. A wide variety of other courses in the program are designed to offer fundamental training for students majoring in chemistry or for students in other science areas, such as biology or health-related occupations. The curriculum, faculty, library, and facilities of the department are approved by the American Chemical Society. Graduating chemistry majors are eligible for certification to become members of the ACS after two years of professional experience.

While all graduate students are required to complete a foundational curriculum of courses in political science theory, research, and presenting social science, the program intentionally allows for a great deal of flexibility. Students can tailor their elective coursework according to their particular interests and goals, and even substitute internships for credit during their second year. This allows the program to work equally well for students who are seriously contemplating the pursuit of a doctoral degree in political science as well as those interested in careers in law, legislative affairs, or the foreign service. The Department also participates in the Master of Public Policy program and the Public Affairs and Policy Ph.D. program . Admission requirements Political Science M.S. Political Science M.S. The M.S. in Political Science is a two-year program (although part-time study is possible) that provides students with the theories, research skills, and practical understanding of government and politics necessary to pursue both professional and academic careers. It is unique among masters programs in political science in offering a course of study especially designed to prepare students to succeed as doctoral students in the discipline's most competitive Ph.D. programs. For students less interested in academic careers, the program offers flexibility to design a course of study well suited to professions in such fields as law, public policy, legislative affairs, and the foreign service. Learning outcomes include: - Knowledge of the main theories and methodological approaches defining two of the subfields of political science, with a more advanced mastery of one of them. - Ability to independently evaluate conflicting arguments, interpret evidence from alternative analyses, and make reasoned conclusions from the evidence available. - Analytic skills to formulate an original research question, design and carry out an appropriate study for answering the question, and communicate the findings to a scholarly community. Requirements During the first year of the program, all Master's degree students are required to take a 1-credit orientation course PS 590 ; two courses on theory and research in political science; their choice of two seminars in the primary subfields of political science; and two additional political science electives. A 1-credit Thesis course is required during the third semester, during which students will develop ideas, initial research, and a proposal for their master's thesis topic . The second year is structured around researching and writing the master's thesis, with the aim of defending in the final semester. Students are also required to take a 2-credit teaching course PS 589 ; their choice of three elective courses and/or up to 8 credits of internship. Coursework, including credit for work on the master's thesis (see below), is distributed as follows: First Year Coursework Fall PS 511 Advanced Overview of Political Science 4 PS 590 Introduction to Graduate School: Skills for Scholarly Success 1 PS 5XX Field Seminar 4 or PS 5XX Political Science Elective 4 Winter PS 594 / PAP 690 Research Design for Politics and Policy 4 PS 5XX Political Science Elective 4 PS 5XX Field Seminar 4 or PS 5XX Political Science Elective 4 Spring PS 591 Testing Theories in Political Science 4 PS 503 Thesis 1 PS 5XX Field Seminar 4 or PS 5XX Political Science Elective 4 Second Year Coursework Fall PS 503 Thesis 3 PS 589 How to Teach and Present Social Science Research 2 PS 5XX Political Science Elective 4 or PS 504 Internship 4 Winter PS 503 Thesis 3 PS 5XX Political Science Elective 4 or PS 504 Internship 4 Spring PS 5XX Political Science Elective 4 PS 503 Thesis 2 The following courses qualify as Field Seminars: PS 520 Seminar on American Political Institutions 4 PS 530 Proseminar in International Relations 4 PS 569 Comparative Political Institutions 4 PS 585 Political Theory and Governance 4 Thesis The final requirement for the degree is the master's thesis--an original investigation that demonstrates mastery of a topic in political science and the ability to communicate this understanding to an audience of one's peers. The thesis topic is chosen during Spring term of the first year in consultation with the student's thesis advisor, who supervises the drafting of a thesis prospectus. The thesis prospectus is defended by the end of the term, at which time the student either receives approval to move forward with thesis research or is directed to revise the prospectus for a second defense in Fall term of the second year. The completed thesis is defended during Spring term of the second year in an oral presentation laying out the purpose, implementation, and findings of the project, and making a case for its contribution to political science scholarship. In order to count toward fulfillment of master's degree requirements, courses must be passed with a grade of B- or above. No more than two online classes can be counted toward the fulfillment of degree requirements ( This limit may be suspended under extenuating circumstances and with the approval of the student's primary advisor and the Program Director.) .

To encourage the development of interdisciplinary graduate study programs, guidelines for course selection are flexible. PSM students must complete at least 48 graduate credits. PSM Requirements The PSM program of study requires a minimum of 48 credits and consists of the following requirements. Complete two certificates (minimum of 32 credits; course overlaps between certificates are not allowed) See Graduate Certificates section below for details and list of certificates Professional Development Courses (minimum 4 credits): ESM 551 (4 credits) Complete a project or internship (minimum 4 credits) Total Credit Hours: 48-54 Depending on the certificates completed students may need to complete additional coursework to complete the 48 credit minimum required for the PSM. The additional credits can come from a list of professional development courses and/or an additional 4 credits of additional project/internship coursework. A maximum of 8 credits in 504 or 506 will be allowed for the degree. Graduate Certificates The degree will require students to complete two graduate certificates from a menu of approved graduate certificates offered in the Environmental Science and Management, Geology, and Geography Departments, as well as other related graduate certificates. In addition to the two graduate certificates, students will complete 4 - 12 credits in professional development coursework (including a required course in project management) and a 4-8 credit project or internship supervised by a faculty member affiliated with the program. For the first certificate, choose at least one graduate certificate from list A: Hydrology GIS Hydrogeology Engineering Geology Environmental Geology For the second certificate, choose another graduate certificate from list A above or a graduate certificate from the following list B: Sustainability Conflict Resolution Sustainable Food Systems Environmental and Resource Economics Emergency Management and Community Resilience Details of all of the above graduate certificates are linked above; more details can be found by searching the PSU graduate certificate website . Courses used for one graduate certificate requirements cannot count towards the requirements of the second graduate certificate. Students are encouraged to work with the PSM director or certificate directors to identify appropriate course pathways.

Degree requirements Award of the Ph.D. is the culmination of a sequential process of coursework, comprehensive examinations, and the research, writing, and defense of a doctoral dissertation. In addition to the department core coursework, each field has additional specialization requirements. The total number or credit hours required for the degree is 93, distributed as follows: Core Coursework-- 21 credits Research Methods-- 24 credits Field Electives-- 21 credits Dissertation-- 27 credits As a cohort, first-year students take a series of six courses commonly referred to as \"the core\" and are examined on this material upon completion. During their second and third years, students complete their field and research methods coursework. The comprehensive examination that follows the satisfaction of all course requirements typically asks students to think prospectively about the application of this material to their dissertation work. After the completion and defense of a dissertation proposal, students advance to Ph.D. candidacy. The last remaining hurdle is the dissertation. Prerequisites All students entering the doctoral program must have completed a basic course in statistics either upon entering or within the first year of study.

Comprehensive examinations In order to evaluate one's ability to integrate, analyze, and critique the diverse materials and ideas presented in the PAP curriculum, students are required to complete a two-part comprehensive examination. Part A of the examination (core exam) covers the 21 credit hours of foundational core courses. Part B (field exam) covers all coursework done in the student's specialization field. Part A is a written exam taken upon completion of the core coursework. Part B has written and oral components to the exam and is typically taken upon completion of all coursework. Dissertation requirements The dissertation process is designed to evaluate the student's ability to successfully conduct a significant, independent applied research project. The dissertation thesis represents the culmination of a student's doctoral studies. Program Rules A more comprehensive set of rules governing satisfactory completion of field area examinations, presentation of dissertation, and timely completion of doctoral program requirements appear in the General Handbook for the Public Affairs and Policy Doctoral Program issued to incoming students and available upon request. Limitation on graduate/undergraduate courses Students in the PAP program are strongly advised to use no more than 12 credits of courses offered simultaneously at the 400- and 500-level in support of their degree programs. These courses must be an integral part of the student's program, and courses with the same content must not be available on a purely graduate basis. Limitation on by-arrangement courses Admitted Ph.D. students may utilize no more than 12 credits of Research and/or Reading and Conference credits (501/601 and 505/605). In cases where more than 12 credits are needed because of the lack of regularly scheduled classes, the student must submit a written request waiver to their adviser for approval. Continuous enrollment and leave of absence All students admitted to the Ph.D. program in public affairs and policy must be continuously enrolled until graduation, except for periods in which they are absent for an approved leave. Taking a minimum 3 credits per term during the regular academic year will constitute continuous enrollment for students taking coursework. Taking a minimum of 1 credit of PAP 603 or PS 603 during the regular academic year will constitute continuous enrollment for students who have advanced to candidacy. Failure to register without an approved leave may result in termination of a student's admission. Students may have no more than six terms of approved leave. Grade requirement A student who receives more than 9 credits of C+ or below in all coursework attempted after admission to the Ph.D. program will be dropped from the program. Performance in core courses A grade of C+ or below received for work performed in a core course is not considered passing. A PAP doctoral student who receives a grade of C+ or below in one of the core course offerings during fall or winter terms may not proceed to take the core course offerings in the subsequent term until the course in which a failing grade was received has been repeated, and the failing grade is replaced with a passing grade of B- or better. Research and Teaching Opportunities The doctoral degree in public affairs and policy offers a limited number of research and teaching opportunities. Hatfield Residency Program This program, conducted in cooperation with the Hatfield School's Center for Public Service, places qualified doctoral students in public and not-for-profit agencies as paid residents. Agency placements provide students opportunities to conduct dissertation research, gain advanced research experience, and receive assistance in financing their educational objectives. Graduate research assistantships Depending on available funds, a limited number of graduate research assistantships are available each year. Students must apply for these by February 1st of the academic year in which the assistantships are desired. Assistantships pay tuition up to 9 credits and associated fees as well as a small additional stipend. Teaching opportunities Doctoral students with an interest in developing competencies in teaching in a higher education setting are encouraged to teach prior to completing their Ph.D. programs. There are a limited number of opportunities available in this regard. Teaching apprenticeships with a university faculty member These duties can include teaching one or more class sessions, assistance in preparing courses, and correction of examinations. Students are encouraged to consult with their faculty adviser to develop opportunities for teaching apprenticeships. Teaching in the University Studies Program Advanced doctoral students may also teach in sophomore inquiry coursework sponsored by the College of Urban and Public Affairs. This coursework deals largely with citizen participation and leadership. Advanced doctoral students may also propose and teach a senior Capstone course at the undergraduate level. These are interdisciplinary community-based courses required of all PSU seniors.

Requirements This program is for students who are interested in understanding environment-society interactions through a social science lens. This will help prepare students seeking to enter environmental policy and governance careers, as well as those seeking to contribute to environmental success stories and inform positive socio-environmental change. Future careers for students in this major could include environmental policy, local, state or federal environmental agencies, environmental law, environmental governance and management, environmental consulting, environmental education, environmental nonprofits, and graduate work in human-environment studies. The major focuses on providing social science foundations, including critical theoretical and humanities approaches, with a focus on equity, justice and policy applications. This major is distinct from the Environmental Sciences major (science track and management track) which focuses more explicitly on science and would be appropriate for students seeking science-based careers. While this major includes basic scientific foundations in climate and ecosystem science, it does not involve extensive science credits and instead takes an interdisciplinary social science focus. Students taking the Environmental Studies major are encouraged to pursue minors and certificates to complement the major and to focus on specific areas of interest, including: Climate science (ESM/GEOG); water resources (GEOG); GIS (GEOG); environmental science (ESM); sustainability (ESM).

The program leads to a B.S. or B.A. in Speech and Hearing Sciences, or a certificate with baccalaureate in Communications Sciences and Disorders (CSD). The coursework explores foundational knowledge in speech and hearing sciences, clinically-based knowledge related to communication, cognition, swallowing and hearing disorders, and the complexity and diversity of human communication. In addition to providing a rigorous liberal arts education, this degree provides a foundation for many career paths, including graduate work in speech-language pathology, audiology, and/or speech, language, and hearing research. Because communication is central to most human activities, a degree in Speech and Hearing Sciences can also lead to a career in many other fields, including Education, Counseling, Psychology, Social Work, and Community Relations. Coursework or a degree in Speech and Hearing Sciences complements degrees in other programs, such as education, linguistics, psychology, public health administration, social work, music, and allied health professions. The CSD Certificate provides a strong educational foundation for entry into graduate programs in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology, fulfills all but one requirement for entry into PSU's graduate program in SPHR, and provides the required educational component for licensing of Speech-Language Pathology Assistants in Oregon and other states.

It is one of four intersectional units in the School of Gender, Race, and Nations. The Department of Black Studies is devoted to the exploration and analysis of all aspects of African people and people of African descent in the United States, the Caribbean/Latin America, and Europe. It seeks to research and teach about the Black experience through the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary contributions of its faculty by providing comprehensive learning programs aimed at greater understanding of the historical and contemporary experiences of people in Africa and African descended people across the Americas, the Caribbean, Oceania, Asia, and Europe. The Department of Black Studies provides students who opt for the Black Studies major, minor, certificate, or as an addition to majors such as Anthropology, English, Sociology, Community Studies, History, etc., a variety of course offerings. These courses serve to expand students' breadth of knowledge in related courses offered by the department or as a complement to those in other departments. Students gain an understanding of the complex relationships across and between race/racism, gender/sexism, sexuality/homophobia, class differences and inequalities. The Department of Black Studies incorporates in its understandings and analysis of Black Life cultural themes such as music, literature, and film; institutions like the family, religion, housing, employment, criminal injustice system and health care; and the more general realms of culture and political economy into its curriculum and its courses. The program provides students with a general historical background of the Black experience in Africa and the Western hemisphere, as well as locally. Students also examine contemporary inter- and intra-racial/ethnic dynamics and are encouraged to engage in study and/or civic engagement courses to support their interests in global and community studies. The Department of Black Studies prepares students to work with African, Black or African American communities and to apply for graduate studies in a variety of disciplinary and professional programs. It will also give students a crucial competitive advantage in obtaining careers in those areas and within communities that interact with African, African American, Afro-Asiatic, Afro-Oceanic, and Caribbean/Latin American cultures. Students interested in any of the degree programs offered in the Department of Black Studies are strongly encouraged to enroll in BST 202: Introduction to Black Studies or any other 200-level course. Students should meet with the undergraduate advisor for assistance with course selection based on their interests. For students who plan to apply to graduate school, it is important that they meet with one of their professors, the undergraduate advisor, or the department chair during their junior year, in order to discuss options for courses to enhance their research skills, such as the practicum, reading and conference, or other experiential learning courses.

Its study has made possible a modern understanding of the origin of the universe as well as the behavior of biological materials and chemical processes. Scientists trained in this field can engage in such diverse areas as solid state devices, particle physics, energy and the environment, biotechnology, and space travel. The study of physics does not involve the following of a specific recipe or set of rules; rather it entails developing an attitude or way of looking at phenomena and asking questions. Physicists seek to understand how the physical universe works, no matter what the scale of observation--from quarks to quasars, from the time it takes the proton to spin, to the age of the cosmos. The answers to these questions are summarized into statements called laws. We live in the age of physical law. Awareness of the beauty, harmony, and interplay of the laws of physics greatly enhances our view and appreciation of our environment. As an undergraduate, you will take a group of core courses that will give you a general background in the subject. You will study force and motion, heat, optics, electricity, magnetism, atomic and nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, and the physical properties of materials, learning both the theoretical and the experimental aspects. Physicists are employed by almost all industries, particularly by the technical industries and by government laboratories. Roughly half of all students with a bachelor's degree in physics go on to graduate work. In addition to a traditional graduate curriculum in physics or astronomy, they can enter programs in optics, applied physics, engineering physics, and education. Biophysics, material science, atmospheric physics, environmental science, medical physics, and finance are particularly popular fields now. Environmental programs, electrical engineering, nuclear engineering, and computer science are common graduate school tracks. Medicine and law are also fields that welcome students with physics degrees. Many physicists are entrepreneurs who start their own companies. Degree Maps and Learning Outcomes Admission requirements Physics B.A./B.S. Physics Minor Physics Honors Track Physics Secondary Education Program Physics B.A./B.S. It is important that students planning to major in physics contact the Department of Physics prior to the start of their work in order that a coherent program can be planned with their assigned adviser. Students planning to transfer to PSU from community colleges or other universities are strongly advised to contact the Department of Physics well ahead of their proposed date of transfer so that a smooth transition, which avoids course duplication and untimely delays, can be accomplished. Students need to choose between the standard option, the environmental physics option, the engineering physics option, and the biomedical option.

It meets the demands of an accredited first professional degree in architecture as determined by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Through a series of focused design studios, and courses in humanities, technology and the profession, the program encourages depth in questioning, aptitude in discursive thinking, and versatility in means of representation as each student assimilates the skills, knowledge and dexterity to negotiate the professional demands of comprehensive design while developing a mode of creative inquiry that extends beyond established conventions to possibilities yet to be tested in a critical arena. Student generated questions and polemics will form the inspiration for the final year Design Thesis exploration culminating in a unique thesis proposal fully articulated in drawings, models and text. We offer two tracks towards the Master of Architecture: the 2-year track for candidates with a pre-professional undergraduate degree in Architecture (74 credits); and the 3-year track for candidates with a Bachelor's degree in any discipline (134 credits). We also offer two graduate certificates: a Graduate Certificate in Public Interest Design consisting of coursework and fieldwork that will prepare future leaders in architecture and related fields to aid currently underserved populations throughout the world through sustainable design methods, with an emphasis on addressing social, economic and environmental issues; and a Graduate Certificate in Urban Design, focusing on the design of urban public space, offered in partnership with the Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning. Admission requirements Architecture M.Arch. 2 year Architecture M. Arch. 3 year Public Interest Design Grad Cert Urban Design Grad Cert Urban Design Graduate Certificate Two things about cities, their design and planning, have become abundantly clear in the early 21st century: first, even at the largest scales, the details matter, and second, good policy is important, but it's not enough to create a great place. Together, these two lessons of the last 100 years of urban placemaking in America have brought new interest and attention to urban design. What is Urban Design? The term generally means the process for shaping urban growth, conservation and change - making design decisions about individual buildings as well as big plans about the design of streets, public spaces, and collections of buildings. Urban design combines the aesthetic and three-dimensional design skills of the architect with the decision-making, engagement, and management methodologies of the urban planner. What excites the urban designer is the making of memorable and artful places - places that are pleasant to be in as well as go through, places that reflect the uniqueness of different communities. The Graduate Certificate in Urban Design at Portland State University, a joint effort of the Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning and the School of Architecture, has been created to offer planners, designers, and architects the opportunity to engage and incorporate in their own work the principles and methods of urban design. It utilizes the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan region as a laboratory, an urban place renowned for its use of urban design and attention to urban design concerns. This certificate is intended for those who are currently seeking an advanced planning or architecture degree, or who are currently employed as a professional planner, architect, or designer. Coursework The Graduate Certificate in Urban Design consists of five required core courses, for a total of 20 credit hours. Core Requirements Theory Arch 532 History and Theory of Urban Design 4 USP 513 Public Space 4 Methods Arch 521 Urban Design Methods 4 Practice USP 575 Urban Design Workshop 4 Arch 531 Studies in Contemporary Urban Design 4 If a student cannot fulfill one of the classes in the certificate, the student can take an equivalent class to the one missed, to be approved by the committee on a case-by case basis. Application and Admission Requirements Admission to the Graduate Certificate in Urban Design program is limited to graduate students currently enrolled in either the MURP or M.ARCH programs; graduate students in other programs who have an undergraduate or graduate design degree, those who have completed an undergraduate or graduate design degree, or those who have completed a graduate planning degree from an accredited planning degree program. In addition, admission to graduate study at Portland State University is granted on the basis of evidence of suitable preparation and the probability of success in the intended field of study. Admission generally requires a minimum of an accredited baccalaureate degree and a GPA which meets university graduate admission standards. Typically, students admitted to graduate study at Portland State have an undergraduate or graduate (minimum of 12 credit hours) GPA of at least 3.0. If you meet all of these requirements, please visit the websites of either the Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning ( www.pdx.edu/usp ) or the School of Architecture ( www.pdx.edu/architecture ) for more information.

Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies advisers work closely with each student to craft a course of study appropriate to the student's academic interests and post-graduate goals. An expanding field of scholarship, women, gender, and sexuality studies is on the cutting edge of educational and intellectual innovation. The department offers two different majors: the Women's Studies major, and the Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies major. The Women's Studies major encourages students to develop critical thinking skills and an appreciation for the range of theoretical frameworks and methodologies present in contemporary feminist scholarship. Courses incorporate the diversity of women's experience with attention to race, class, and sexual orientation as well as gender. Core courses also encourage students' active participation through discussion, informal as well as formal writing, and collaborative learning in the classroom. The major in Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies (SGQS) is designed to provide an in-depth study of sexual desire, sexual behavior and identity, gendered behavior, gender identity, and the sexed body as socially, culturally, and historically produced. The core curriculum emphasizes queer and trans of color theorizing and critiques including queer indigenous, Two-Spirit, and transnational perspectives; critical analysis of the relationships between sexuality and other power formations such as gender, race, class, nation, ability, nature, citizenship, age, and size; historical contexts and contemporary connections among rigorous theoretical, activist, political, and practice-oriented approaches; and an interdisciplinary, queer, and decolonial approach to analyses of the creative arts, humanities, and health and social sciences. Experiential learning plays an important role in a student's progress through the women, gender, and sexuality studies curriculum. The program's extensive and long-established ties with organizations in the Metro area provide wide-ranging opportunities for students to apply their classroom knowledge in a community setting. Many students discover a life's vocation through these experiences, and all develop new skills. Guidelines for women, gender, and sexuality studies practica and independent study are flexible in order to meet individual needs. Degrees in Women's Studies and Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies provide the foundations for life-long learning as well as background and experience for careers in teaching, counseling and social work, business, law, health sciences, public administration, public relations, and academia.

Requirements for the course are contained in the handout: M.S. in Mathematics for Teachers' Curriculum Projects. Planning a MS-MTCH Degree Program: Many of the courses are offered on a three-year cycle. Refer to the Course Projection Guide (CPG, https://app.banner.pdx.edu/cpg/ ). It is important to take as many of the required courses as you can prior to choosing elective courses. Also, start thinking about the 501 Mathematics Curriculum Project early in your program. It generally takes at least three terms to narrow in on a topic, choose a 501 adviser, put a project committee together, do the background research, develop the materials and test them with students, evaluate the results, finish the entire paper, and make a public presentation of your work. Meeting with the MS-MTCH program adviser to plan your degree will make the process much smoother.

Program Rules A more comprehensive set of rules governing satisfactory performance in the MPP can be found in the Handbook for the Master of Public Policy Program issued to incoming students and available online. Limitation on graduate/undergraduate courses Students in the MPP program are strongly advised to use no more than 12 credits of courses offered simultaneously at the 400- and 500-level in support of their degree programs. These courses must be an integral part of the student's program, and courses with the same content must not be available on a purely graduate basis. Limitation on by-arrangement courses Admitted Ph.D. students may utilize no more than 12 credits of Research and/or Reading and Conference credits (501/601 and 505/605). In cases where more than 12 credits are needed because of the lack of regularly scheduled classes, the student must submit a written request waiver to their adviser for approval. Continuous enrollment and leave of absence All students admitted to the MPP program must be continuously enrolled until graduation, except for periods in which they are absent for an approved leave. Taking a minimum 3 credits per term during the regular academic year will constitute continuous enrollment. Failure to register without an approved leave may result in termination of a student's admission. Students may have no more than six terms of approved leave. Professional Development Opportunities The MPP program offers a number of professional development opportunities outside of the curricular requirements of the program. Policy Competitions Participation in national and international policy competitions is a common aspect of professional education in public policy. Each year, MPP students, under the direction of an MPP faculty member, will be able to participate in policy competitions. Oregon Public Policy Research Network Through the Center for Public Service, the Hatfield School of Government is a founding member of the Oregon Public Policy Research Network. The Center and the Network engage in contract-based public policy research. Advanced MPP students will have the opportunity to work with the CPS to expand its public policy research.", "metadata": {"source": "https://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2023-2024/bulletin/college-of-urban-and-public-affairs/mark-o-hatfield-school-of-government/masters-programs/public-policy-master", "title": "\r\n\tPortland State University\u00a0-\u00a0Master of Public Policy\r\n", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Graduate programs The Fariborz Maseeh Department of Mathematics and Statistics offers work leading to the degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Science, the Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences and the Ph.D. in Mathematics Education as well as the Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics.

CHLA seeks to explore Chicanx/Latinx experiences through an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach to center the lived experiences and the production of knowledge of Chicanx/Latinx communities. Faculty examine how race, ethnicity, language, sexuality, gender, and other social identities intersect in Chicanx/Latinx communities and within the larger U.S. landscape. At its core, CHLA employs a decolonial, anti-racist, anti-sexist, framework to challenge centuries of white supremacy, settler colonialism, and other systems of oppression that have impacted how Chicanx/Latinx communities live, work, create, and thrive. Graduates with a degree, minor, or certificate in Chicano/Latino studies will have augmented their major field of study by broadening their scope of knowledge. They will have gained important insight into a very different culture within U.S. borders. This increased awareness and insight will lead to successful interaction on many levels of society.

Central themes of analysis include the understanding, practice and implementation of Seventh Generation philosophy; recognizing the role of the sacred and that all land is sacred; reciprocity and interdependence; respecting cultural protocols and cultivating healthy relationships; expanding understandings of the concept that \"We are all related\"; new partnership in education and land reclamation utilizing Indigenous cultural practices and holistic sustainability models; implications of ITECK on long-term land restoration and management practice and utilization of ITECK to restore the land on behalf of regional native flora and to deepen understanding, knowledge, and engagement through seasonal harvests, tending, culturally significant programming and community engagement with tribal, Urban Native, historically marginalized, and other regional communities. In recent years, Western Science has \"discovered\" what Indigenous People have known since Time Immemorial and Indigenous oral histories continue to confront and correct inaccurate and incomplete historical accounts. Indigenous Ways of Knowing centers kinship and the reciprocal relationship between people and our environment. Through critical analysis of socially constructed narratives, the certificate will explore contemporary themes, such as community health, food sovereignty, Indigenous land management and practices, community development, resilience, and self-determination.

The Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) program at Portland State University is fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). MSW Program Mission The mission of the Portland State University MSW program is to educate students for advanced leadership and practice that recognizes and dismantles systems of oppression; builds racial equity and social, political, and economic justice; and advances the well-being of diverse individuals, families, groups, organizations, communities, and tribal nations. We endeavor to deliver a social work education that is critically informed, theoretically driven, empirically supported, reflexive, ethical, vigilant and resistive to colonial, heteropatriarchal, classist, and white supremacist agendas. MSW Program Goals: The MSW Program mission is realized by providing a statewide program that prepares social workers for practice and leadership with diverse individuals, families, groups, communities and organizations. The goal is to prepare MSW social workers to: Provide advanced practice and leadership in healthcare and aging, clinical mental health, services to children, youth and families, communities, and/or organizations Practice effectively with individuals, groups, families and communities to improve their well being Demonstrate a professional use of self and a commitment to practice within social work values and ethics Engage in critically informed, non-discriminatory, collaborative practice that addresses/challenges oppression and reflects respect, knowledge, and skills related to race, color, ethnicity, culture, social and economic class, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, family structure, language, national origin, age, disability, and religion Use knowledge of systemic oppression and privilege, community and organizational change processes, and practice skills to advance social and economic justice Analyze, formulate, and influence policies to improve practice and advance social and economic justice Use practice experience, empirical evidence, and theory to guide practice Develop a plan and motivation for continued professional development, learning, and growth to enhance their social work skills and to contribute to the social work profession's efforts to advance social justice after graduation. The master's program offers students three courses of study: (1) Face-to-face instruction on the Portland campus; (2) Asynchronous instruction in the online platform; (3) Hybrid instruction in Distance locations - Eugene and Central Oregon. Students can choose a full time or part-time course of study in the Portland and Online options. The distance options only offer a part-time course of study. The curriculum combines concurrent on-campus coursework and field work in a range of human service organizations. Typical practice settings are mental health programs, public welfare and human service agencies, schools, hospitals and health care centers, courts, family service agencies, correctional services, community planning agencies, legislative offices, child and youth service agencies, neighborhood centers, multicultural service centers, and programs for older adults. To ensure a common base for social work practice, the faculty has identified a required generalist foundation curriculum to be completed by all students in the MSW Program, except those admitted to advanced standing. This coursework focuses on the knowledge, values, skills and behaviors related to work with individuals, families, groups, communities and organizations. Three terms of concurrent generalist field internship are an integral part of this foundation. The advanced curriculum includes advanced concentrations, advanced field internship and electives. The M.S.W. Portland Program offers two advanced concentrations: Advanced Clinical Practice and Advanced Macro Practice. The electives provide opportunities for students to have a deeper learning experience with a specific population, problems, or intervention. The M.S.W. Distance Option (DO) program offers one advanced concentration in Advanced Clinical Practice. In fall 2023, there will be two cohorts in Central Oregon engaging in the first and third year of instruction. Eugene will have a cohort in their final of the program year. While the first year of distance learning is course work only, second year students have 12 hour per week field internships and third year students have 16 hour per week field internships in or near their home communities. All Distance Option courses are offered on site or online. The M.S.W. Online program offers two advanced concentrations: Advanced Clinical Practice and Advanced Macro Practice. Course instruction is exclusively online using asynchronous and synchronous delivery methods. Students will be expected to attend a virtual two-day orientation at the beginning of each academic year. Required courses are offered during the academic year and electives are offered in the summer. Students admitted to the Advanced Standing option have a BSW from a CSWE accredited school of social work, and complete the advanced year of the curriculum over the course of four-five terms. Students in the MSW program have the ability to pursue a dual degree or certificate in specialized areas of practice. Students may combine the M.S.W. with a Masters in Public Health (M.P.H.) by applying to both programs. Students may obtain the M.S.W. with a certificate in gerontology through the Institute on Aging by completing specialized courses and field placement. Students may also pursue licensure as a school social worker by completing a specialized set of courses and field placement.

University Honors College Students Students in the University Honors College majoring in mathematics have two options for completing their Honors thesis project: Option 1: Apply to join the Mathematics Departmental Honors Track program, complete the required coursework, and register for Hon 403 : Thesis Prospectus (4 credits) in the quarter immediately preceding the Mth 401 : Honors Project (3 credits). During the thesis prospectus course students will work with their mathematics honors project adviser in the department of Mathematics and Statistics to identify a research question and topic, which they will then carry out during the quarter they are registered for Mth 401 . University Honors College will accept the Mth 401 credits in lieu of additional Hon 403 thesis credits. The Mth 401 research project will fulfill the honors thesis requirement. (Students are permitted to register for Hon 403 : Thesis Continuation credits if they would prefer additional support or credit hours.) Students are required to give an oral presentation of their completed research projects to faculty and students in the Mathematics and Statistics department as well as at the Honors Thesis symposium for University Honors College faculty and students. Students earn both Mathematics Departmental Honors and University Honors. Option 2: University Honors College students who do not meet the minimum requirements or who choose not to join the Mathematics Departmental Honors Track program must still fulfill the requirements of two approved 400 level sequences in mathematics and/or statistics. They are then eligible to proceed with the mathematics honors research project, taking Hon 403 : Thesis Prospectus and then Mth 401 : Honors Project under the supervision of a Mathematics and Statistics faculty adviser.

Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies advisers work closely with each student to craft a course of study appropriate to the student's academic interests and post-graduate goals. An expanding field of scholarship, women, gender, and sexuality studies is on the cutting edge of educational and intellectual innovation. The department offers two different majors: the Women's Studies major, and the Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies major. The Women's Studies major encourages students to develop critical thinking skills and an appreciation for the range of theoretical frameworks and methodologies present in contemporary feminist scholarship. Courses incorporate the diversity of women's experience with attention to race, class, and sexual orientation as well as gender. Core courses also encourage students' active participation through discussion, informal as well as formal writing, and collaborative learning in the classroom. The major in Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies (SGQS) is designed to provide an in-depth study of sexual desire, sexual behavior and identity, gendered behavior, gender identity, and the sexed body as socially, culturally, and historically produced. The core curriculum emphasizes queer and trans of color theorizing and critiques including queer indigenous, Two-Spirit, and transnational perspectives; critical analysis of the relationships between sexuality and other power formations such as gender, race, class, nation, ability, nature, citizenship, age, and size; historical contexts and contemporary connections among rigorous theoretical, activist, political, and practice-oriented approaches; and an interdisciplinary, queer, and decolonial approach to analyses of the creative arts, humanities, and health and social sciences. Experiential learning plays an important role in a student's progress through the women, gender, and sexuality studies curriculum. The program's extensive and long-established ties with organizations in the Metro area provide wide-ranging opportunities for students to apply their classroom knowledge in a community setting. Many students discover a life's vocation through these experiences, and all develop new skills. Guidelines for women, gender, and sexuality studies practica and independent study are flexible in order to meet individual needs. Degrees in Women's Studies and Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies provide the foundations for life-long learning as well as background and experience for careers in teaching, counseling and social work, business, law, health sciences, public administration, public relations, and academia.

It is one of four intersectional units in the School of Gender, Race, and Nations. The Department of Black Studies is devoted to the exploration and analysis of all aspects of African people and people of African descent in the United States, the Caribbean/Latin America, and Europe. It seeks to research and teach about the Black experience through the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary contributions of its faculty by providing comprehensive learning programs aimed at greater understanding of the historical and contemporary experiences of people in Africa and African descended people across the Americas, the Caribbean, Oceania, Asia, and Europe. The Department of Black Studies provides students who opt for the Black Studies major, minor, certificate, or as an addition to majors such as Anthropology, English, Sociology, Community Studies, History, etc., a variety of course offerings. These courses serve to expand students' breadth of knowledge in related courses offered by the department or as a complement to those in other departments. Students gain an understanding of the complex relationships across and between race/racism, gender/sexism, sexuality/homophobia, class differences and inequalities. The Department of Black Studies incorporates in its understandings and analysis of Black Life cultural themes such as music, literature, and film; institutions like the family, religion, housing, employment, criminal injustice system and health care; and the more general realms of culture and political economy into its curriculum and its courses. The program provides students with a general historical background of the Black experience in Africa and the Western hemisphere, as well as locally. Students also examine contemporary inter- and intra-racial/ethnic dynamics and are encouraged to engage in study and/or civic engagement courses to support their interests in global and community studies. The Department of Black Studies prepares students to work with African, Black or African American communities and to apply for graduate studies in a variety of disciplinary and professional programs. It will also give students a crucial competitive advantage in obtaining careers in those areas and within communities that interact with African, African American, Afro-Asiatic, Afro-Oceanic, and Caribbean/Latin American cultures. Students interested in any of the degree programs offered in the Department of Black Studies are strongly encouraged to enroll in BST 202: Introduction to Black Studies or any other 200-level course. Students should meet with the undergraduate advisor for assistance with course selection based on their interests. For students who plan to apply to graduate school, it is important that they meet with one of their professors, the undergraduate advisor, or the department chair during their junior year, in order to discuss options for courses to enhance their research skills, such as the practicum, reading and conference, or other experiential learning courses.

It meets the demands of an accredited first professional degree in architecture as determined by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Through a series of focused design studios, and courses in humanities, technology and the profession, the program encourages depth in questioning, aptitude in discursive thinking, and versatility in means of representation as each student assimilates the skills, knowledge and dexterity to negotiate the professional demands of comprehensive design while developing a mode of creative inquiry that extends beyond established conventions to possibilities yet to be tested in a critical arena. Student generated questions and polemics will form the inspiration for the final year Design Thesis exploration culminating in a unique thesis proposal fully articulated in drawings, models and text. We offer two tracks towards the Master of Architecture: the 2-year track for candidates with a pre-professional undergraduate degree in Architecture (74 credits); and the 3-year track for candidates with a Bachelor's degree in any discipline (134 credits). We also offer two graduate certificates: a Graduate Certificate in Public Interest Design consisting of coursework and fieldwork that will prepare future leaders in architecture and related fields to aid currently underserved populations throughout the world through sustainable design methods, with an emphasis on addressing social, economic and environmental issues; and a Graduate Certificate in Urban Design, focusing on the design of urban public space, offered in partnership with the Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning.

Biostatistics Courses Community & Public Health Courses Environmental Systems & Human Health Courses Epidemiology Courses Environmental Systems and Human Health MPH The MPH in Environmental Systems & Human Health (ESHH) program offers ecosystem-based public health training for students who would like to investigate and remediate environmental impacts on human health. Believing that a healthy environment is a cornerstone of preventive medicine, the goal of the ESHH track is to produce graduates who will be able to analyze relationships between human activities, the environment, and human health. Areas of emphasis include environmental change and its effect on human health, environmental pathogens, environmental transport, fate and remediation of chemical contaminants, food web bioaccumulation, wastewater treatment, environmental risk assessment and toxicity testing, culturally competent risk communication, and social justice issues. Within the program special attention will be given to mediating and modifying the effects of environmental disruptions on the health of vulnerable populations in a culturally competent, ethical manner. Program Competencies Students graduating from this program will be able to: Communicate the relationship between environmental systems and human health, particularly in response to a changing climate. Analyze how environmental hazards (chemical, physical and biological) interact with natural and built systems, including the mechanisms of their adverse effects on humans. Assess and interpret relevant literature in the area of public health and environmental hazards. Evaluate the risk of environmental exposures to human populations through the incorporation of exposure, toxicological, and other relevant data into risk assessment methodology. Discuss how federal and state regulatory programs, guidelines and authorities impact environmental and occupational health issues. Apply ethical principles that govern the practice of environmental risk assessment, management, and communication. Specify approaches for assessing, preventing and controlling environmental and occupational hazards that pose risks to human health and safety. Integrate, synthesize and apply theory to practice in the context of a research study, policy consequences, or environmental exposure. Explain the general mechanisms of toxicity in eliciting a human health effect in response to various environmental and occupational exposures.

It meets the demands of an accredited first professional degree in architecture as determined by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Through a series of focused design studios, and courses in humanities, technology and the profession, the program encourages depth in questioning, aptitude in discursive thinking, and versatility in means of representation as each student assimilates the skills, knowledge and dexterity to negotiate the professional demands of comprehensive design while developing a mode of creative inquiry that extends beyond established conventions to possibilities yet to be tested in a critical arena. Student generated questions and polemics will form the inspiration for the final year Design Thesis exploration culminating in a unique thesis proposal fully articulated in drawings, models and text. We offer two tracks towards the Master of Architecture: the 2-year track for candidates with a pre-professional undergraduate degree in Architecture (74 credits); and the 3-year track for candidates with a Bachelor's degree in any discipline (134 credits). We also offer two graduate certificates: a Graduate Certificate in Public Interest Design consisting of coursework and fieldwork that will prepare future leaders in architecture and related fields to aid currently underserved populations throughout the world through sustainable design methods, with an emphasis on addressing social, economic and environmental issues; and a Graduate Certificate in Urban Design, focusing on the design of urban public space, offered in partnership with the Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning.

Arch. 3 year Public Interest Design Grad Cert Urban Design Grad Cert Architecture M.Arch: 2-year track Degree Requirements Students must complete a minimum of 74 graduate level credits including the following: Courses Arch 530 Contemporary Architectural Theory 4 Arch 53x Architectural Theory Elective 4 Arch 540 Professional Practice 4 Arch 54x Professional Practice Elective 4 Arch 560 Advanced Architectural Technology 4 Arch 580 Architectural Design Studio 7 6 Arch 581 Architectural Design Studio 8 6 Arch 582 Architectural Design Studio 9 6 Arch 511 Pro-Thesis Seminar 4 Arch 584 Design Development Studio 6 Arch 585 Design Thesis 6 Arch 586 Integrated Systems 6 5xx Special Interest Electives 14 Total Credit Hours: 74 The Master of Architecture program is designed for students intending to become licensed architects and has full professional accreditation with the National Architectural Accrediting Board. In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree. Portland State University, School of Architecture offers the following NAAB accredited degree program in architecture: M.Arch (pre-professional degree + 74 graduate credits). Next accreditation visit for all programs: 2023. The School of Architecture reserves the right to retain permanently for archival or exhibition purposes any student work executed as part of a School of Architecture instructional program. In addition, the School reserves the right to document, reproduce, and publish images of any such student work in PSU publications, printed or electronic, for the purposes of research, publicity, and outreach, giving publication credit to the student. Owning a laptop computer system will provide critical advantages in your progress through the Architecture program, especially the ability to work in any of our classrooms and studios. Therefore, all students studying Architecture are required to own a laptop computer that meets minimum system specifications published by the School, including software required for courses in our program. Contact the School office for complete information on our Student Laptop Program, or consult the school website. Grades of C+ or lower will not count towards meeting Master of Architecture degree requirements.

It aims to develop student's ability to conduct and share original research. The program is flexible, learner driven, and provides participants with a structured environment, professional guidance, and advising support. Mathematical Sciences at PSU encompass a wide range of specialties as can be seen from our faculty profiles webpage . Traditionally at PSU, students often engage in multidisciplinary research work and take graduate courses in other departments. The program prepares for academic professions as well as a broad range of non academic professions. Indeed, Mathematical Sciences form an integral part of emerging fields such as computational medicine/biology, artificial intelligence, information security, and e-sciences. In today's data-intensive world, Mathematical Sciences allow to answer questions and solve problems in areas as diverse as economics and finance, government and law, the arts and music, medicine, weather and air quality forecasting, climate modeling, and national defense in addition to its traditional application in the physical sciences. The program is flexible, learner driven, and provides participants with a structured environment, professional guidance, and advising support. The program accommodates a broad range of interdisciplinary partners. Students choose a main concentration within the Mathematical Sciences as well as a secondary concentration. This secondary concentration can be chosen within the Mathematical Sciences or alternatively, within the natural sciences, social sciences, or engineering. Typical examples of secondary concentrations outside of Mathematical Sciences include Computer science, Engineering, Physics, Biology, Economics, Systems Science, Finance, Urban Studies and Planning, Public Health and Medicine. Admission Program prerequisites: Applicants for admission to the Mathematical Sciences Ph.D. program will be expected to have completed an undergraduate degree with the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in Mathematics or Statistics containing an adequate background in Computer Science. Applicants with degrees in related disciplines will be considered provided the applicant demonstrates a strong mathematical proficiency. Admission to the program requires that the department find the applicant prepared to undertake study leading to the doctoral degree in mathematics. In addition to program prerequisites, applicants must meet the university's minimum admission requirements including English language proficiency . This program admits once per year for fall term only. See instructions on how to apply: https://www.pdx.edu/math/graduate-application-instructions Degree requirements Below is an overview of the program. For additional details please read the general rules in the Graduate School section of the PSU Bulletin. I. Planning a Ph.D. in Mathematical Science Program: Upon admission to the program the student will be assigned an academic adviser providing support for the student's exam schedule and program of courses. After satisfactory completion of the qualifying and comprehensive examinations, a dissertation committee headed by a thesis adviser will be appointed to supervise the remainder of the student's program. The Graduate School has a summary of the procedures for doctoral degrees on their website: https://www.pdx.edu/gradschool/summary-of-procedures-doctoral-degrees II. Course requirements: A minimum of 81 credit hours distributed as follows: Approved graduate level courses - 42 credits a) Primary concentration: Mathematics and Statistics courses at the 600 level - 18 credit minimum. b) Secondary concentration: courses at the 600 level in Mathematics and Statistics or courses at the 500 and 600 level offered in another discipline - 9 credit minimum. c) Other courses in Mathematics and Statistics at the 500 and 600 level, including Mth/ Stat 601 (non-dissertation research) - 15 credits. For students entering the program with a Master's degree, up to 9 credits can be transferred from graduate Mathematics or Statistics courses offered in other universities. Mathematical/Statistical Literature and Problems course (Mth/ Stat 501 ) - 3 credits. This requirement can be waived in full or partially in case of a Master's thesis or a similar exercise performed in another university. When a partial waiver is provided, the candidate is asked to perform an oral presentation of his Master's thesis or similar exercise under the rules of the Mth/ Stat 501 course. Doctoral seminar ( Mth 607 ) or Internship ( Mth 604 ) - 9 credits. Dissertation ( Mth 603 ) - 27 credits. Moreover, the candidate will be expected to participate in colloquia and research seminars presented in the department. III. Examinations: Qualifying examinations: These exams are intended to verify that the student has the prerequisites for high-level mathematical courses and also to verify that the student has the basic capabilities and interest in mathematical research. This examination consists of two Master's level written examinations offered in the Fariborz Maseeh Department of Mathematics and Statistics (\"the department\"), as well as defending a Mth 501 / Stat 501 Mathematical/Statistical Literature and Problems course. In both cases, this course consists of reading critically a research article and presenting it in writing as well as orally in front of a mathematically literate audience. The qualifying examinations are to be completed before the end of the second year after enrollment in the program, so that the student may engage early-on in the study of higher level mathematics and in research. Comprehensive examinations: This is an oral exam conducted by an examining committee composed of three or more PSU faculty members, a majority of which hold a primary appointment in the department. The scope of the exam is determined by a syllabus prepared by the candidate's examining committee. The syllabus reflects the primary as well as the secondary concentration of the candidate. A student may receive from the examining committee a grade of unconditional pass, conditional pass (with conditions specified by the examining committee), or fail. A (strict) majority of votes in favor of either pass or conditional pass is needed for the student not to fail the exam. The candidate is allowed to stand for this exam at most twice, and must pass this exam within five years after entering the program to continue. IV. Dissertation: Upon the successful completion of the course and examination requirements, the student proposes for approval by the Mathematical Sciences Ph.D. committee and subsequently by the Graduate School, a dissertation committee. This committee comprises a research adviser who is a faculty member in the department and at least three other faculty members.

Systems Science Ph.D. Graduate Certificates Computational Intelligence Graduate Certificate Computer Modeling Simulation Graduate Certificate Systems Minor Systems Science Courses Systems Science Ph.D. Doctor of Philosophy in Systems Science The doctoral program emphasizes systems ideas and methods, more specifically systems thinking, system structure and dynamics, data modeling, computer simulation, networks, complex adaptive systems, and decision analysis. Subject areas include environmental systems, sustainability, energy, health policy, biomedicine, and other areas where systems ideas or methods make unique contributions to knowledge. Admission Requirements To apply to the doctoral program, applicants must submit the following to for evaluation by the Systems Science Admissions Committee: A completed Application to Graduate Program form, Academic transcripts from each institution attended, GRE scores, Three letters of recommendation, Personal statement explaining student's interests and goals, and TOEFL score or other evidence of English competency if attending as foreign student. Degree Requirements General requirements for doctoral degrees can be found at the Graduate School . Additionally, Systems Science requires that students complete 84 graduate credit hours, which can include up to 28 hours of graduate credits completed at other institutions. 48 credits must be completed prior to comprehensive exams; 9 additional credits are required prior to advancement to candidacy, and 27 dissertation credits are required prior to graduation. Students must take SySc 511 (Systems Theory) and SySc 513 (Problem Solving) as letter-graded courses, and must take 3 credits of SySc 507 (Seminar). The remaining 46 hours are completed via one of two options: 1. Core option. Students must complete an additional 24 credits of letter-graded Systems Science labeled courses. The remaining 22 credits might be systems science labeled courses, by-arrangement credits, or courses from an outside discipline. The student's three comprehensive exams will cover 48 credit hours, including two SySc exam areas of at least 16 credits each, and one field exam area of at least 15 credits. 2. Multidisciplinary option. Students must complete an additional 16 credits of letter-graded Systems Science labeled courses plus 15 or more credits from each of two outside and distinct disciplines. The student's three comprehensive exams will cover 48 credit hours, including one SySc exam area of at least 16 credits, and two choice exam areas with at least 15 credits each. All doctoral students must pass all letter-graded courses with at least a B grade, and their cumulative GPA must be at least 3.25. Once a student has completed all of the coursework required for his or her comprehensive examinations, he or she forms a comprehensive examination committee with three members, including a core faculty member from Systems Science. Comprehensive Examinations. Within two to three years after admission (five years maximum), doctoral students must pass their comprehensive exams consisting of three written exams and an oral exam by his or her comprehensive exam committee. For core option students, two exams will cover SYSC areas and one will cover a field area of the student's choice. For multidisciplinary option students, one exam will cover SYSC areas and two exams will cover field areas representing two distinct and different disciplines of the student's choice. Advancement to Candidacy. After passing comprehensive exams, the student prepares a prospectus for dissertation research and recruits dissertation committee members under his or her adviser's supervision. An application is sent to the Graduate School, who will officially appoint the committee. Once appointed, the chair of the committee becomes the student's adviser. The student then prepares a proposal for independent research that will result in a significant and original contribution to knowledge in the systems field. When the proposal is approved by the committee and the 57 credit hour requirement (including transfer credits) and all other conditions have been met (including IRB approval if human subjects are involved), the student is advanced to candidacy. PSU requires students to be advanced to candidacy within 3 years of completing their comprehensive examinations. Dissertation . Once the doctoral student has been advanced to candidacy, he or she completes the proposed dissertation work. Prior to their dissertation defense, doctoral students present their research at the Systems Science Seminar. The candidate's final defense of his or her completed dissertation is a presentation open to the public. It must be completed by the end of the 6 th week of a term, and no later than 5 years after the student's advancement and no later than 12 years after the student's admission. Typically, the dissertation is completed in one or two years after the proposal is approved. The formal defense is often preceded by a pre-defense meeting two weeks earlier, where the committee may recommend the candidate do more work before attempting the final formal defense. Prior to graduation, students must register for 27 credits of dissertation research ( SySc 603 ), 9 of which may be taken upon completion of comps; another 9 may be taken after the dissertation committee has been requested (with form GO-16D); the rest must be taken after the dissertation proposal has been approved. The student can anticipate approximately four to six years of full-time study beyond the baccalaureate degree in order to satisfy the program requirements.

It is one of four intersectional units in the School of Gender, Race, and Nations. The Department of Black Studies is devoted to the exploration and analysis of all aspects of African people and people of African descent in the United States, the Caribbean/Latin America, and Europe. It seeks to research and teach about the Black experience through the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary contributions of its faculty by providing comprehensive learning programs aimed at greater understanding of the historical and contemporary experiences of people in Africa and African descended people across the Americas, the Caribbean, Oceania, Asia, and Europe. The Department of Black Studies provides students who opt for the Black Studies major, minor, certificate, or as an addition to majors such as Anthropology, English, Sociology, Community Studies, History, etc., a variety of course offerings. These courses serve to expand students' breadth of knowledge in related courses offered by the department or as a complement to those in other departments. Students gain an understanding of the complex relationships across and between race/racism, gender/sexism, sexuality/homophobia, class differences and inequalities. The Department of Black Studies incorporates in its understandings and analysis of Black Life cultural themes such as music, literature, and film; institutions like the family, religion, housing, employment, criminal injustice system and health care; and the more general realms of culture and political economy into its curriculum and its courses. The program provides students with a general historical background of the Black experience in Africa and the Western hemisphere, as well as locally. Students also examine contemporary inter- and intra-racial/ethnic dynamics and are encouraged to engage in study and/or civic engagement courses to support their interests in global and community studies. The Department of Black Studies prepares students to work with African, Black or African American communities and to apply for graduate studies in a variety of disciplinary and professional programs. It will also give students a crucial competitive advantage in obtaining careers in those areas and within communities that interact with African, African American, Afro-Asiatic, Afro-Oceanic, and Caribbean/Latin American cultures. Students interested in any of the degree programs offered in the Department of Black Studies are strongly encouraged to enroll in BST 202: Introduction to Black Studies or any other 200-level course. Students should meet with the undergraduate advisor for assistance with course selection based on their interests. For students who plan to apply to graduate school, it is important that they meet with one of their professors, the undergraduate advisor, or the department chair during their junior year, in order to discuss options for courses to enhance their research skills, such as the practicum, reading and conference, or other experiential learning courses.

The undergraduate program seeks to educate students about the causes, consequences, prevention, and control of criminal and law-violating activity at multiple levels of analysis. Our undergraduate curriculum focuses on (1) criminology and criminal justice theories and empirical research addressing the role of individuals, families, communities, and society in the production and prevention of crime, (2) the justice system's function in controlling crime, and (3) a critical analysis of the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of related policies and practices. Educational experiences facilitated inside and outside of class help promote students' long term professional success by developing their capacity for critical reasoning, problem-solving, and effective communication. Criminology & Criminal Justice is an interdisciplinary major, a fact demonstrated by the diverse backgrounds of our full-time and part-time faculty. Students graduating from our program have a wide range of choices when they look for employment or post-graduate education. Recent graduates have found jobs in law enforcement (e.g., police officer, immigration, crime analyst), courts (e.g., victim advocate, administration), corrections (e.g., parole officer, facility management), human services (e.g., offender counseling, child welfare), and crime prevention (e.g., neighborhood crime prevention specialist, private security). Other alumni from our program have gone on to pursue advanced degrees in such areas as law, criminal justice, psychology, social work, public administration, and urban planning.

Criminology and Criminal Justice Minor Criminology and Criminal Justice Post-Baccalaureate Certificate Criminology and Criminal Justice Post-Baccalaureate Certificate To earn a post-baccalaureate certificate in criminology and criminal justice students must complete core and elective courses within the department. Some of these courses may have prerequisites and students should read course descriptions in the current PSU Bulletin before registration.

CHLA seeks to explore Chicanx/Latinx experiences through an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach to center the lived experiences and the production of knowledge of Chicanx/Latinx communities. Faculty examine how race, ethnicity, language, sexuality, gender, and other social identities intersect in Chicanx/Latinx communities and within the larger U.S. landscape. At its core, CHLA employs a decolonial, anti-racist, anti-sexist, framework to challenge centuries of white supremacy, settler colonialism, and other systems of oppression that have impacted how Chicanx/Latinx communities live, work, create, and thrive. Graduates with a degree, minor, or certificate in Chicano/Latino studies will have augmented their major field of study by broadening their scope of knowledge. They will have gained important insight into a very different culture within U.S. borders. This increased awareness and insight will lead to successful interaction on many levels of society.

A liberal education is an education for life. It prepares students to make informed decisions about their lives and to think critically and analytically. All students--Liberal Arts and Sciences majors as well as those from professional schools and programs--take a selection of courses that represent the three areas of the college: arts and letters, science, and social science. Course offerings range from those designed to provide a foundation for all baccalaureate degrees to those of an advanced, specialized nature. Acquiring a balanced and integrated liberal education requires planning and consultation with an adviser. Faculty advisers in each department and program are available to help students structure their academic careers so they may get the most from their college experience.

Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies advisers work closely with each student to craft a course of study appropriate to the student's academic interests and post-graduate goals. An expanding field of scholarship, women, gender, and sexuality studies is on the cutting edge of educational and intellectual innovation. The department offers two different majors: the Women's Studies major, and the Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies major. The Women's Studies major encourages students to develop critical thinking skills and an appreciation for the range of theoretical frameworks and methodologies present in contemporary feminist scholarship. Courses incorporate the diversity of women's experience with attention to race, class, and sexual orientation as well as gender. Core courses also encourage students' active participation through discussion, informal as well as formal writing, and collaborative learning in the classroom. The major in Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies (SGQS) is designed to provide an in-depth study of sexual desire, sexual behavior and identity, gendered behavior, gender identity, and the sexed body as socially, culturally, and historically produced. The core curriculum emphasizes queer and trans of color theorizing and critiques including queer indigenous, Two-Spirit, and transnational perspectives; critical analysis of the relationships between sexuality and other power formations such as gender, race, class, nation, ability, nature, citizenship, age, and size; historical contexts and contemporary connections among rigorous theoretical, activist, political, and practice-oriented approaches; and an interdisciplinary, queer, and decolonial approach to analyses of the creative arts, humanities, and health and social sciences. Experiential learning plays an important role in a student's progress through the women, gender, and sexuality studies curriculum. The program's extensive and long-established ties with organizations in the Metro area provide wide-ranging opportunities for students to apply their classroom knowledge in a community setting. Many students discover a life's vocation through these experiences, and all develop new skills. Guidelines for women, gender, and sexuality studies practica and independent study are flexible in order to meet individual needs. Degrees in Women's Studies and Sexuality, Gender, and Queer Studies provide the foundations for life-long learning as well as background and experience for careers in teaching, counseling and social work, business, law, health sciences, public administration, public relations, and academia.

Our work is critical to understanding and developing sustainable ecosystems, human societies, and economies. Environmental Science and Management at PSU focuses on processes that link terrestrial, urban and aquatic ecosystems, consequences of human alteration of those linkages, and development of policies to manage human interaction with the environment. We conduct our research by studying organisms and specific linkages and processes across systems and by studying interactions between organisms, processes, and linkages in a specific ecosystem or watershed, such as the Columbia River Basin. The Department of Environmental Science and Management prepares students to develop the skills and interdisciplinary understanding to be scholars and managers of human interaction with, and impact on, environmental systems. The Department of Environmental Science and Management cooperates with several departments and centers, including the departments of Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Economics, Geography, Geology, History, Mathematics, Physics, Political Science, Sociology; and the School of Business Administration and the College of Urban and Public Affairs.

It is one of four intersectional units in the School of Gender, Race, and Nations. The Department of Black Studies is devoted to the exploration and analysis of all aspects of African people and people of African descent in the United States, the Caribbean/Latin America, and Europe. It seeks to research and teach about the Black experience through the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary contributions of its faculty by providing comprehensive learning programs aimed at greater understanding of the historical and contemporary experiences of people in Africa and African descended people across the Americas, the Caribbean, Oceania, Asia, and Europe. The Department of Black Studies provides students who opt for the Black Studies major, minor, certificate, or as an addition to majors such as Anthropology, English, Sociology, Community Studies, History, etc., a variety of course offerings. These courses serve to expand students' breadth of knowledge in related courses offered by the department or as a complement to those in other departments. Students gain an understanding of the complex relationships across and between race/racism, gender/sexism, sexuality/homophobia, class differences and inequalities. The Department of Black Studies incorporates in its understandings and analysis of Black Life cultural themes such as music, literature, and film; institutions like the family, religion, housing, employment, criminal injustice system and health care; and the more general realms of culture and political economy into its curriculum and its courses. The program provides students with a general historical background of the Black experience in Africa and the Western hemisphere, as well as locally. Students also examine contemporary inter- and intra-racial/ethnic dynamics and are encouraged to engage in study and/or civic engagement courses to support their interests in global and community studies. The Department of Black Studies prepares students to work with African, Black or African American communities and to apply for graduate studies in a variety of disciplinary and professional programs. It will also give students a crucial competitive advantage in obtaining careers in those areas and within communities that interact with African, African American, Afro-Asiatic, Afro-Oceanic, and Caribbean/Latin American cultures. Students interested in any of the degree programs offered in the Department of Black Studies are strongly encouraged to enroll in BST 202 : Introduction to Black Studies or any other 200-level course. Students should meet with the undergraduate advisor for assistance with course selection based on their interests. For students who plan to apply to graduate school, it is important that they meet with one of their professors, the undergraduate advisor, or the department chair during their junior year, in order to discuss options for courses to enhance their research skills, such as the practicum, reading and conference, or other experiential learning courses.

Bachelor's + Master's Program Minor in Anthropology Secondary Education Program--Social Science M.A., M.S. Anthropology is the study of biological and cultural diversity across time and space, from the primates and our bipedal ancestors to human societies in prehistory and the modern world. As anthropologists, we have a keen understanding of the complexities of our past, the interconnections between biology and culture, and the urgent social problems of our times. Students can develop their expertise in topics such as cultural heritage, human-environment interactions ,climate change, and biodiversity conservation, design and user experience, structural racism, violence, migration, primatology, gender and sexuality, food systems, globalization, and human health and medicine. Students gain knowledge and skills through a variety of classroom, online, lab and internship opportunities. This experience prepares students for careers with federal and state agencies, NGOs, tribes, public/community health organizations, biomedical research institutions, consulting firms, activist groups, museums, corporations, academia and more. Our department supports three subfields: archaeology, sociocultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. Our regional specializations lie in Madagascar, Asia, Latin America, the Arctic, and western North America. We are dedicated to applied research and scholarship that addresses real world issues through problem solving and the co-creation of knowledge and solutions with the communities where research and interventions are conducted. Central to our collective endeavors is critically reflecting on the colonial histories and epistemologies of anthropology as an academic discipline and profession. We are committed to including a plurality of theoretical and methodological perspectives in our pedagogy, particularly those of non-Western and underrepresented scholars. Our research practices advance collaborative, participatory, and praxis-based approaches that decenter authority in knowledge production. We prioritize engaging with practitioner communities, extending anthropological knowledge and insights beyond the academy, and expanding diversity within the faculty, student body and discipline as a whole.

Graduate Certificate in Conflict Resolution (GCCR-CR) Graduate Certificate in Applied Conflict Resolution (GCCR-GCAP) The Bachelors of Arts/Sciences, the Minor and Master of Arts/Sciences degree programs in conflict resolution are trans-disciplinary, encompassing the practical and theoretical bases of mediation and negotiation, involving research, theory, and competency-based education to help build conditions necessary for positive peace, conflict transformation (from destructive to constructive), and universal respect for context-sensitive human rights. Students in the conflict resolution programs learn how to analyze conflict, uncover the underpinnings of conflicts in a wide variety of settings and scales. Students gain skills to defuse and deescalate destructive conflicts that arise among individuals, groups, and countries. Bachelor's degree holders are suited to entry-level careers in the field of conflict resolution, as well as being prepared to add value in any community setting, occupational field or workplace by bringing conflict transformation strategies to bear. Master's degree holders are prepared for leadership positions in conflict management and intervention via governmental, non-governmental, and corporate actors in local, regional, national and international settings. Minor degree holders add a conflict resolution component to their credentials while majoring in any field of study. Both the graduate and undergraduate programs provides skill development through an integration of theory, method, and practice. Undergraduates acquire these skills commensurate with those required for working in peace and conflict settings, as well as those that add value to any community and occupational category. They go on to focus on transformation of conflict for the achievement of peace and social justice at the small group and community level. Graduate students emphasize implications of skill development for leadership in conflict and peace intervention, and go on to focus on perspectives, strategies and processes at the organizational level of peace building and conflict transformation.

CHLA seeks to explore Chicanx/Latinx experiences through an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach to center the lived experiences and the production of knowledge of Chicanx/Latinx communities. Faculty examine how race, ethnicity, language, sexuality, gender, and other social identities intersect in Chicanx/Latinx communities and within the larger U.S. landscape. At its core, CHLA employs a decolonial, anti-racist, anti-sexist, framework to challenge centuries of white supremacy, settler colonialism, and other systems of oppression that have impacted how Chicanx/Latinx communities live, work, create, and thrive. Graduates with a degree, minor, or certificate in Chicano/Latino studies will have augmented their major field of study by broadening their scope of knowledge. They will have gained important insight into a very different culture within U.S. borders. This increased awareness and insight will lead to successful interaction on many levels of society.

Official withdrawals Students receiving financial aid who need to completely withdraw from classes during a term should officially withdraw (see the instructions in the Schedule of Classes). By using the official withdrawal procedures, students will have tuition refunds calculated by the Student Accounts Department. Regardless of \"official withdraw\" or Financial Aid, Student Financial Services will still calculate any possible refunds. Students receiving financial aid who completely withdraw up to the 60 percent point of a term, will be identified. Financial aid staff will use the federal Return of Title IV Funds formula to calculate the percentage of financial aid earned versus the percentage of aid that must be returned to federal aid program accounts. In some cases, the Return of Title IV Funds calculation may take all of a student's tuition refund to repay federal aid accounts. In addition, students may be responsible for repayment of federal financial aid program funds. Funds are returned to the financial aid programs from which they were awarded, starting with the loan programs. Students who are considering withdrawing from a term should contact staff in the Office of the Registrar. 2. Unofficial withdrawals Students who stop attending without officially withdrawing from Portland State University are considered to have unofficially withdrawn. Students who unofficially withdraw may receive all X or M grades at the end of a term. A grade of X is defined as no basis for grade or non-attendance. A grade of M designates a missing grade. Students who receive financial aid for a term and unofficially withdraw are identified at the end of each term. Each student receiving financial aid who has unofficially withdrawn must provide proof of attendance for the term(s). Students who provide proof of attendance may be subject to the Return of Title IV Funds policy. Students who fail to provide proof of attendance will have all financial aid received repaid to federal accounts (including PLUS loans) and a university accounts receivable will be established. Refund calculations are based on total tuition and fees. Special fees are nonrefundable. Refunds are computed from the date of official withdrawal or drop; they are not based on when attendance in class ceased. Students who are delayed in withdrawal process for reasons beyond their control may petition for an earlier drop date via a Deadline Appeals petition obtained through the Office of the Registrar. Refund consideration is automatic; no special request is necessary. Action to process a refund cannot begin until after the end of the fourth week of the term.

We strive for problem-solving innovation. We believe everyone should be treated with integrity and respect. Engaged with the community With more than 22,000 students, Portland State University is a nationally recognized leader in community engagement, combining academic rigor in the classroom with community-based learning. While students from across the country and around the world come to Portland State, close to 80% of students are from Oregon and most will stay in the state after graduation. They choose Portland State because its urban setting and ties to businesses and service organizations make it a living laboratory that prepares tomorrow's leaders with the experience they need to succeed. Portland State has a national reputation for innovation, community engaged learning and social mobility and it is recognized as a valuable engine for Oregon's economy and its workforce. Distinguished Programs and Faculty Many of Portland State's disciplinary programs are nationally ranked in the top 20 in the United States, and the Princeton Review lists PSU among its Best Colleges. The innovative University Studies program, a four-year general education program which promotes community-based, interdisciplinary learning, and engagement with real-world problems, has established Portland State as a national model for other colleges and universities. The University Honors College is the only urban-focused honors college in the country. Here, a small, dedicated community of highly motivated students and engaged professors explore an academically intense curriculum through the lens of the culturally rich, ever-evolving city of Portland. Portland State professors are prized for their knowledge, research and service. Faculty come to Portland State from colleges and universities around the world. Though diverse in culture, background, language, and ethnicity, they come to Portland unified in their commitment to the University's exceptional approach to learning and engagement. PSU's motto, \"Let knowledge serve the city,\" inspires faculty research. PSU professors research some of society's greatest challenges--providing students with firsthand knowledge and opportunities for involvement and collaboration in their communities. Faculty use their expertise to serve the region through their work with businesses, nonprofits, and governmental agencies and by holding key posts in professional, cultural, and civic groups. Portland: The community is our campus. Portland State University's vibrant location in the middle of a major city guarantees students are always steps from excitement and action. Parks, museums, cafes, theaters, shopping, acclaimed restaurants, and professional sports are all easily accessible. Established in 1946 to meet the educational needs of GIs home from World War II battlefields, Portland State found its first home in Vanport, a former community along the Columbia River. Following the tragic Vanport Flood, the campus moved to Lincoln Hall in Portland's South Park Blocks in 1952 and now stretches across 44 downtown acres, retaining a park-like beauty within its urban setting. Students and faculty often gather in the Park Blocks to talk or study. PSU's Urban Center is home to the busiest public transportation hub in the city. It's the only location in the city where TriMet's bus system, Portland Streetcar, and the MAX light rail line come together. Hundreds of students get to campus under their own power, commuting by foot or bicycle along Portland's pedestrian and bike-friendly streets. With urban sophistication, small-town accessibility, and many outdoor activities, Portland and Portland State offer a great living and learning experience. Sustainability: It's what we do. For the last decade, Portland State has maintained a Gold rating in the rigorous Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS), standing out for its environmental practices, progress on climate adaptation, and sustainability-focused education. The Portland State campus itself is a model for sustainability; each new building or major renovation on campus since 2004 has received a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. Portland State students can take sustainability lessons beyond the classroom, engaging directly with the community and businesses to solve real-world problems and achieve further sustainability at the local and regional levels through internships, co-ops and other opportunities. Portland State strives to harness the strengths of the university to move closer to solving the environmental, social, and economic problems of our time. Faculty and students perform valuable research and developing solutions to address issues related to homelessness, climate change, public health, and urbanization. Students in departments across campus consider issues that integrate economic, social, and environmental viewpoints. Armed with this knowledge and experience, and a strong sense of ethical leadership, they will lead the next generation in building a more equitable, livable, resilient world. Research & Graduate Studies PSU is the region's leading urban research university and offers wide-ranging research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students who aspire to be explorers, innovators, problem-solvers, and change-makers. Our faculty includes internationally recognized researchers in engineering and physical, natural and social sciences, as well as the arts and humanities. PSU researchers are making vital contributions in fields ranging from climate science to the development of new treatments for diseases and the search for life beyond Earth. Our research strengths in specialized fields such as early childhood learning and biochemistry attract world-class partners like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. And programs like NIH-funded Build EXITO provide students with access to cutting-edge research as well as training and professional development opportunities. Opportunities to explore entrepreneurship and commercialization of student and faculty intellectual property are provided through Propel PSU's Center for Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Intellectual Property, and the Portland State Business Accelerator. Researchers at PSU work across disciplines and partner with industry, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and other universities to address the critical challenges of the 21st century and improve life in Oregon, the nation, and the world. We collaborate with Oregon Health & Science University through the OHSU-PSU School of Public Health and interdisciplinary research where our expertise in data analysis, social science, biology, and chemistry add value to OHSU's clinical studies. Our University Research Centers work to improve urban life by evaluating \"smart city\" technologies, exploring solutions to complex issues such as homelessness, and improving transportation. At PSU, we bring the future into focus. The Founding of Portland State University Portland State University's roots trace back to the summer of 1946 when the Oregon State Board of Higher Education approved the opening of a temporary school in North Portland to offer lower-division coursework. Vanport Extension Center (VEC), named for its location between Portland and Vancouver, was situated in Vanport City, a wartime housing project that promised resident and classroom space for the students attending VEC. Spearheaded by founder and director, Stephen Epler, VEC soon became known as \"Vanport College\" and was immediately successful in meeting local demands for higher education by returning World War II servicemen and women. When fall term registration closed at VEC, more than 1,400 students enrolled, eclipsing the projection of 500 and signaling future success for the center. Seemingly ending VEC's future, the 1948 Memorial Day flood of the Columbia River destroyed Vanport City, including the center. Epler and his colleagues kept the school alive, using federal funds to reinstate the campus at \"Oregon Ship,\" a former Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation site. The school's commitment and fighting spirit earned it the national reputation as \"the college that would not die.\" Students, faculty, community groups, and legislators were strong advocates for the school, spurring its permanence and move in 1952 to its present location in Portland's South Park Blocks, where it became the Portland State Extension Center in the former Lincoln High School (now Lincoln Hall). In 1955, the legislature created Portland State College as a four-year degree-granting institution. Graduate work was added in 1961; doctoral programs began in 1968, and the institution became Portland State University in 1969. The University has grown from an initial enrollment of 1,410 students in 1946 to become one of Oregon's largest universities. \"Portland State formed a legacy of courage, leadership, dedication, and collaboration during its founding years, 1946-1955. These qualities enabled a small extension center to become a four-year, degree-granting college. Today this legacy inspires Portland State University to enhance the intellectual, social, cultural, and economic vitality of Portland, the Pacific Northwest, and beyond.\" 1 The Founder and presidents who have served the University are: Stephen E. Epler (Vanport Extension Center), 1946 to 1952; John F. Cramer, 1955 to 1958; Branford P. Millar, 1959 to 1968; Gregory B. Wolfe, 1968 to 1974; Joseph C. Blumel, 1974 to 1986; Natale A.

Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited college or university is one which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding an institution's accredited status by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities should be directed to the administrative staff of the institution.

Vanport Extension Center (VEC), named for its location between Portland and Vancouver, was situated in Vanport City, a wartime housing project that promised resident and classroom space for the students attending VEC. Spearheaded by founder and director, Stephen Epler, VEC soon became known as \"Vanport College\" and was immediately successful in meeting local demands for higher education by returning World War II servicemen and women. When fall term registration closed at VEC, more than 1,400 students enrolled, eclipsing the projection of 500 and signaling future success for the center. Seemingly ending VEC's future, the 1948 Memorial Day flood of the Columbia River destroyed Vanport City, including the center. Epler and his colleagues kept the school alive, using federal funds to reinstate the campus at \"Oregon Ship,\" a former Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation site. The school's commitment and fighting spirit earned it the national reputation as \"the college that would not die.\" Students, faculty, community groups, and legislators were strong advocates for the school, spurring its permanence and move in 1952 to its present location in Portland's South Park Blocks, where it became the Portland State Extension Center in the former Lincoln High School (now Lincoln Hall). In 1955, the legislature created Portland State College as a four-year degree-granting institution. Graduate work was added in 1961; doctoral programs began in 1968, and the institution became Portland State University in 1969. The University has grown from an initial enrollment of 1,410 students in 1946 to become one of Oregon's largest universities. \"Portland State formed a legacy of courage, leadership, dedication, and collaboration during its founding years, 1946-1955. These qualities enabled a small extension center to become a four-year, degree-granting college. Today this legacy inspires Portland State University to enhance the intellectual, social, cultural, and economic vitality of Portland, the Pacific Northwest, and beyond.\" 1 The Founder and presidents who have served the University are: Stephen E. Epler (Vanport Extension Center), 1946 to 1952; John F. Cramer, 1955 to 1958; Branford P. Millar, 1959 to 1968; Gregory B. Wolfe, 1968 to 1974; Joseph C. Blumel, 1974 to 1986; Natale A. Sicuro, 1986 to 1988; Roger N. Edgington (interim president), 1988 to 1990; Judith A. Ramaley, 1990 to 1997; Daniel O. Bernstine, 1997 to 2007; Michael F. Reardon (interim president), 2007 to 2008; Wim Wiewel, 2008 to 2017; Rahmat Shoureshi, 2017 to 2019 Stephen Percy, (interim president 2019 to 2020) appointed president 2020 to 2023; and Ann E.

Arch: 2-year track and 3-year track Graduate Certificate in Public Interest Design Graduate Certificate in Urban Design The architecture program engages students in the fascinating creative questions that pertain to the making of architecture. The program develops the creative identity of each student while nurturing civic responsibility, critical judgment and the representational and technical ability to translate ideas into plausible architectural works. This lies at the core of an educational experience that provides a rich initiation into the world of architectural practice and preparation for a career as a licensed professional. The heart of the program resides in the architecture design studio and is nourished by the accompanying lecture and seminar courses that bring focused study in the humanities, technology, and the profession. Alongside a progressive attitude to design process and theoretical speculation, the program participates in the advancement of knowledge in contemporary issues and technologies of sustainable urban living and environmental stewardship. In giving place to human situations architecture bears the responsibility of being the most public of the arts and it cannot be practiced meaningfully without a conversation with the community at large. Our design studio classes, in particular, are sustained by an engagement beyond the university to the life-world we share with our urban cohabitants, including direct interaction with the architectural practice community through our adjunct professors, critics, guest speakers and advisers. This fosters the generation of imaginative responses to the challenge of 'what ought to be' in the context of 'what is'. The educational emphasis of the program encourages students to recognize the value of creative engagement with the prevailing realities of the city as a primary means of cultural transformation, and to perceive Portland as an 'urban laboratory' for experimental investigations of contemporary human issues. This takes place through interaction and dialogue with the communities at large and by continual acts of interpretive making with diverse media at multiple scales, including full-size fabrication.

For those who fail to alert their COTA School immediately that they are leaving their major, refunds of differential tuition will only be issued for one term prior to the term in which students do notify the COTA School.

Our primary goal is to generate and sustain an environment of creative inspiration and excellence in creation, practice, and appreciation of the performing arts. Framed by the University's motto \"Let Knowledge Serve the City,\" the School presents a wide spectrum of activities by students, faculty, and guest artists which enhance the artistic and cultural life of the city of Portland. We offer a comprehensive array of options for emerging artists, with ten distinct undergraduate degrees including five professional options and four distinct graduate programs. Our dedicated faculty are internationally recognized performers, conductors, composers, directors, playwrights, designers, and scholars. The School embraces the dual goals of open access and outstanding achievement to produce graduates who make a significant impact in the performing arts regionally and beyond. Racial Justice statement The Portland State University School of Music & Theater is a deeply engaged collective of performers, creators, and scholars dedicated to student success. We are acutely aware that the status quo in the performing arts, on stage and in the classroom, exhibits characteristics of systemic racism and colonialism, and advances the privilege of white men of European descent. We recognize that simply inviting members of BIPOC communities to participate in a curriculum centered on European traditions is not enough. While we offer non-western ensembles and dedicated classes exploring literature outside the European canon, we are seeking ways to expand and deepen these offerings so that they form a more central part of our academic programs. Additionally, we are engaged in revising and restructuring our scholarly and performance offerings to include BIPOC individuals as fully active and equally represented participants in our institution. This pledge includes examining our hiring practices in order to build a diverse community that is representative of the world we wish to live and teach in. The administration, faculty and staff of our School are committed to enacting meaningful change with clear and unified goals. We are working towards creating and sustaining a diverse community that celebrates difference, including race, culture, gender, sexuality, age, religion, and ability. We are also invested in promoting consequential discourse that amplifies the voices of those in our community who are marginalized, both historically and presently, in order to shape an equitable vision for our community.
